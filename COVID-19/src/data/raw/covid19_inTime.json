Furthermore, the polyubiquitin chains are formed via various linkages imparting an additional layer of specificity in cellular signaling. In order to adequately study ubiquitin signaling and particularly deubiquitination, a number of ubiquitin activity-based probes (ABPs) were developed and utilized in understanding the deubiquitinase (DUBs) function.

Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards).

Even in those companies with crisis management teams (CMTs), the members often do not meet to plan or even discuss how the team would function in an actual situation. The most progressive firms offer the team members, fire brigades, and employees an opportunity to preplan (contingency planning) through mock exercises that replicate industrial disasters, explosions, fires, or tornado alerts. The end result is a better-prepared team of employees ready to respond to any contingency. Unfortunately, many firms have not gone this far. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today’s global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans. A complete contingency planning program has three major elements: 1. Emergency Response 2. Crisis Management 3. Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption Emergency response activities involve responding to an incident, crisis or disaster and managing that incident at the scene. Should an incident escalate to the crisis or disaster stage, a CMT should take over managing the crisis to its conclusion. If the crisis or disaster does cause damage to a company building, facility or operation, the CMT should hand over to a business continuity team the responsibility of recovery and resumption. After a disaster, it is critical that the business recovers and resumes normal (pre-event) operations as soon as possible. Customers, shareholders and stakeholders expect nothing less. Executive management has the obligation to ensure contingency planning is properly considered and addressed within their company.

Ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues.

Nevertheless, the development of long-haul budget airlines, including Singapore Airlines’ subsidiary Scoot and several long-haul affiliates of AirAsia signals the maturity of the LCC sector.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-811393-6.00008-3","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Index","source":"Low-Cost Carriers in Emerging Countries","keywords":[{"term":"UnknownIndex","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Unknown","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-811393-6.09995-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Index","source":"Encyclopedia of Microbiology","keywords":[{"term":"UnknownIndex","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Unknown","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-811736-1.09957-8","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chapter 13 Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System","source":"The Common Marmoset in Captivity and Biomedical Research","keywords":[{"term":"the Gastrointestinal System","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract In captivity, gastrointestinal diseases are the most common clinical finding in common marmosets.

The vast importance of the Tree of Life falls into several general categories. First, the immense overall importance of biodiversity not only involves providing food, medicines, and ecosystem services such as clean air and water, but also a second major theme of this chapter is the importance to human well-being of knowledge of how species are related. Knowledge of how organisms are related has predictive value. We all know from our own family trees that relationships matter. For example, if a close relative has a disease or cancer that is genetically inherited, we realize that there is a chance we may have inherited that trait. Similarly, broad knowledge of relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting disease, crop improvement, while also providing insight into the study of ecosystem function and services (clean air and water). Knowledge of species relationships and the Tree of Life can help in the discovery of new medicines—closely related organisms produce similar chemicals; similarly, that knowledge of relationships is essential to improve crops by identifying close wild relatives that may have important traits (disease resistance, drought tolerance). Knowledge of the Tree of Life can also aid in the study of ecology and conservation efforts. As closely related species will often respond in similar ways to environmental factors such as temperature and moisture availability, the Tree of Life can also provide critical information in predicting how species may respond to climate change.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-812553-3.00005-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Index","source":"The Great Tree of Life","keywords":[{"term":"UnknownIndex","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Unknown","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-812553-3.00020-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Role of Pharmacists in Responding to Humanitarian Crisis","source":"Encyclopedia of Pharmacy Practice and Clinical Pharmacy","keywords":[{"term":"Humanitarian Crisis","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Medical and pharmaceutical responses are crucial for saving precious lives during any humanitarian crisis.

Further, 20% of the available fresh water is not available to humans living in remote areas, 60% of fresh water cannot be captured, as it comes at inconvenient times and places (e.g., monsoons and floods), and 18% of fresh water is contaminated by human activities. Only about 2% of fresh water is available for usage. Developed countries have advanced technology for water treatment and are thus able to manage the problem of water scarcity to a large extent, but advanced technology is largely unprocurable in developing and undeveloped countries due to cost. Based on the current population growth rate, it has been estimated that over 3.5 billion people will be in a water scarcity condition by 2025. The problem has become exacerbated due to the introduction of various recalcitrant, nondegradable compounds by agricultural and industrial activities. These compounds cannot be removed completely by any current available technologies.

In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof.

Notably, cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are molecules that are implicated in these quorum sensing behaviors in both settings. Bacteria coordinate their collective behavior by producing CDPs (quorum sensing inducers) that enhance the capacity of individual members of the community to detect these signals and thus amplify the community-level response.

However, very few review studies have undertaken grouping according to similarities and differences to predict the personality and behavior of individuals with the help of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to collect data from previous researches and to analyze the methods they have used.

This research is based on the method of previous publications and analyzed the results, limitations, and number of users to draw conclusions. Our results indicated that the percentage of completed research on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram show that 50% of the studies were done on Twitter, 27% on Facebook, and 23% on Instagram. Twitter seems to be more popular and recent than the other two spheres as there are more studies on it. Further, we extracted the studies based on the year and graphs in 2015 which indicated that more research has been done on Facebook to analyze the behavior of users and the trends are decreasing in the following year. However, more studies have been done on Twitter in 2016 than any other social media. The results also show the classifications based on different methods to analyze individual behavior. However, most of the studies have been done on Twitter, as it is more popular and newer than Facebook and Instagram particularly from 2015 to 2017, and more research needs to be done on other social media spheres in order to analyze the trending behaviors of users.

New effective solutions for the treatment of wastewater led to an improvement of the quality of the final effluent but considerably increased the volume of produced sewage sludge, which increases each year. Two points of view conflict regarding the recycling of those “wastes.” Primarily, dehydrated sewage sludge is considered a reservoir of nutrients and organic matter that can be used as a fertilizer in agriculture or as an organic amendment in the remediation of contaminated sites or to build “anthroposoils.” On the other hand, recycled sewage sludge is seen as a potential source of soil contamination by organic and inorganic pollutants and pathogens; potentially toxic elements (such as zinc, copper, cadmium, lead, silver, etc.); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); polychlorobiphenyls (PCB); biocides and phytopharmaceuticals; pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCP), and residuals; synthetic hormones; microplastics; nanotechnology life cycle end products; and microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella typhimurium.

Most of the infectious diseases are caused by drug-resistant microbes; this may lead to a delay in the administration of microbiologically effective therapy (Chen et al., 2017; Del Chierico et al., 2014). Therefore, exhaustive understanding of microbial physiologies, infection and defense systems, and survival strategies is of great interest in order to actively defeat microbial infection. Microbial proteomics provides complete information of microbial physiology and expression and function of the proteins that are involved in infection and also gives a clue in clinical diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy (Pérez-Llarena and Bou, 2016; Vranakis et al., 2014). Microbial proteomics helps to identify the proteins associated with microbial activity, microbial host-pathogen interactions, and antimicrobial resistant mechanism. Microbial activity of pathogens can be confirmed by using the 2-D gel-based and gel-free method with the combination of MALDI-TOF-LC-MS/MS. Proteomic analysis of microbial host-pathogen interaction reveals valuable information about the virulence of the pathogen and its resistance; it helps in better understanding of the infection and for developing strategies against microbial infections (Cheng et al., 2016).

It is a critical resource for the food industry with wide uses. In most of the food preparation and processing operations, water is often taken for granted. Water is very commonly used in food production at various levels, apart from being used as an ingredient. Water quality and its impact on food products and various operations in food industries are often underestimated. Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of revenue, food safety, and product quality. This chapter deals with several aspects of water as applicable to the food production. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, requiring over 100 times more than that used for personal needs. The concept of water footprint is used to discern the importance of relative value in terms of water. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of a wisely chosen crop product with equivalent nutritional value. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water than for cereals and vegetables or fruits. Water is indispensible in cleaning and sanitization in food production, which is an integral part in processing operations in food production. In food storage and preservation, water plays a key role. The water activity of food helps a great deal in deciding shelf-life and food safety. The quality of water is the fundamental consideration in any food production process. The quality depends on the source of water and the actual application in food production. The pollution of water occurs at any stage in various ways. Physical, chemical, or biological agents cause significant health hazards in safe production of food. Contamination of water by several pathological microorganisms creates major challenges in food safety and threats to human and animal health. The majority of diseases which are transmitted through contaminated fresh water, are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Whenever water is used as an ingredient in food product, it must be free from undesirable taste, odor, color, and impurities, including pathogenic organisms that could jeopardize consumers’ health and gravely affect product quality. The quality of water must adhere to the safe drinking water standard. Various techniques and methods of water treatments should be used to purify water as per the guidelines of government authorities to improve food safety. Soil has multiple roles in deciding water quality. Good quality soil has better ability to remove all types of contaminants of water, whereas deteriorated soil becomes a source of heavy metals, organic chemicals, and soil pathogens in water contamination. Use of genetically modified food is gaining much publicity recently. Even though a controversial topic, great care must be taken when genetically modified food is used. It is mandatory that one should review the basic principles of food safety before consuming any food.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-816333-7.00009-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chapter 12 International Laws and Food-Borne Illness","source":"Food Safety and Human Health","keywords":[],"body":"Abstract This chapter begins by describing the food-borne illnesses including all food intoxications and infections with epidemiology, symptoms, pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and recent outbreaks.

However, specific chronic disease is not caused by a specific environmental factor but occurs when the systems of the human body are affected by exposure to specific environmental factors and work beyond their normal ranges.

The diverse structures and small size make the nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unique and remarkable properties, drastically different from its bulk counterparts. Various microorganisms such as actinomycetes, algae, yeast, fungi, and bacteria synthesize inorganic nanoparticles enzymatically, either extracellularly or intracellularly. Various metallic NPs, for example, magnesium, titanium, copper, silver, and gold, are well reported for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. The antimicrobial properties of these NPs may be attributed to its ability to disorganize membrane structure, form pores in the bacterial cell wall, inhibit or disruption biofilm, etc. Most metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO-NPs, exhibit bactericidal properties by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, other NPs like MgO-NPs are effective due to their peculiar physical structure. Nanoparticles can also be fabricated with various bioactive entities. Due to their small and controllable size, functionalized nanoparticles can deliver drugs precisely and safely to the target sites. Thus, microbial mediated production of nanoparticles is gaining substantial interest as a potential solution to the growing need for the development of eco-friendly ways to fight microbial resistance and control diseases.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-12-816504-1.00008-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chapter 9 Vaccines and Immunotherapy","source":"Introductory Immunology","keywords":[{"term":"Immunotherapy","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract This chapter examines the general topic of vaccines.

Most typically caused by respiratory syncytial virus in 70% of cases, the condition lasts for 4 to 7 days, with a prolonged cough in many. Children with comorbidity, particularly those born prematurely or with significant congenital heart disease, are at risk of more severe disease. Nasal obstruction progresses over 3 to 4 days to difficulty with feeding and increased work of breathing with hypoxemia. Crackles and/or wheeze may be auscultated. Apnoea may be a presenting sign in those less than 3 months of age. Viral load is highest at peak of symptoms and in those with more severe disease. Approximately 2% to 3% of all children are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. The differential diagnosis may include bacterial pneumonia, congenital lesions of the lung or heart, or an interstitial lung disease. There are no effective treatments, and admission is for feeding support (by nasogastric or intravenous fluids) or treatment of hypoxemia. Critical care support is required for some infants experiencing respiratory failure, though mortality rates remain unchanged. Practice within and between countries varies significantly and alignment of practice is a common goal of guidelines. Vaccines for RSV are in advanced development, as are several antiviral therapies for RSV. In most children, acute symptoms improve within 5 to 7 days and cough by 2 weeks. Recurrent wheeze is common following acute bronchiolitis and a good association with a diagnosis of asthma in childhood.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00024-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"26 Bronchiectasis and Chronic Suppurative Lung Disease","source":"Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","keywords":[{"term":"Abstract Bronchiectasis","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PBB","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Australian National Health and Medical Research Council","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Centre for Research Excellence","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chronic Suppurative Lung Disease","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PBB","category":"Other"},{"term":"Anne Chang","category":"Other"},{"term":"Greg Redding","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Bronchiectasis, chronic suppurative lung disease, and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) are increasingly recognized conditions. Bronchiectasis is now again increasingly diagnosed, and its renewed interest has resulted in further in-depth studies in children and adults. However, diagnostic labeling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology using adult-derived criteria has substantial limitations. Thus, pediatric-derived criteria are advocated. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails PBB (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggest that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (e.g., immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe “irreversible” radiological bronchiectasis.

This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00028-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"44 Asthma in the Preschool Age Child","source":"Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","keywords":[{"term":"the Preschool Age Child","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Wheeze in preschool children (5 years of age and younger) is common. The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds. Unlike atopic asthma in adults and young people, the underlying pathology of this condition is poorly understood, and the label of “preschool wheeze” should therefore not be regarded as a diagnosis but a description of symptoms. It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00044-4","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Index","source":"Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","keywords":[{"term":"UnknownIndex","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Unknown","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00086-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chapter 95 Management of Infection in Patients With Kidney Transplant","source":"Critical Care Nephrology","keywords":[{"term":"Kidney","category":"Other"},{"term":"Epstein","category":"Other"},{"term":"Multidisciplinary","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract With the pervasive nature of chronic kidney disease, kidney transplantation is likely to continue to increase in the coming years.

The possible etiologies of infection are diverse, ranging from common bacterial and viral pathogens that affect the entire community to opportunistic pathogens that cause invasive disease only in immunocompromised hosts. Antimicrobial therapies required to treat established infection are often complex, with accompanying risks for drug toxicities and drug interactions with the immunosuppressive agents used to maintain graft function. Rapid and specific diagnosis is essential for successful therapy. The risk of serious infections in the organ transplant patient is largely determined by the interaction between two factors: the patient’s epidemiologic exposures and the patient’s net state of immunosuppression. The epidemiology of infection includes environmental exposures and nosocomial infections, organisms derived from donor tissues, and latent infections from the recipient activated with immunosuppression. The net state of immune suppression is a conceptual framework that measures those factors contributing to risk for infection: the dose, duration, and temporal sequence of immunosuppressive drugs; the presence of foreign bodies or injuries to mucocutaneous barriers; neutropenia; metabolic abnormalities including diabetes; devitalized tissues, hematomas, or effusions postsurgery; and infection with immunomodulating viruses. Multiple factors are present in each host. A timeline exists to aid in the development of a differential diagnosis for infection. The timeline for each patient is altered by changes in prophylaxis and immunosuppressive drugs. For common infections, new microbiologic assays, often nucleic acid based, are useful in the diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/B978-0-323-53186-3.00031-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"7 Pretravel Considerations for Non-vaccine-Preventable Travel Infections","source":"Travel Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"Zika","category":"Virus"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Preventive","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pretravel Considerations","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Non-vaccine","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Pretravel advice should be tailored to the individual following a thorough review of his or her itinerary, planned activities, and host characteristics.

These include mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and regionally endemic severe respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and some strains of avian influenza. Zika virus is notable given its capacity for sexual transmission and association with congenital birth defects.

For safety, although disease transmission is a tangible risk, this possibility has been dramatically minimized through modern tissue-processing methods. These include steps to prevent processing tissues with unacceptable bioburden through rigorous screening using donor medical and social histories along with microbial testing of recovered tissue and viral testing of donor serum. Potential bioburden is also controlled through aseptic recovery and processing methods and then reduced through disinfection steps that can include antibiotics, detergents, mechanical process, chemical solutions, and terminal sterilization. Processing steps may also include decellularization methods to lower immunogenic potential of some tissues. To enhance fusion potential of bone void fillers, demineralization steps may be used, and the resultant demineralized bone matrices may be combined with a carrier to improve handling. Bone void fillers and osteochondral allografts may also be specially processed to retain a living cellular component. To preserve relevant biological, biochemical, and physical properties of allografts for clinical use and ease of handling, a number of methods may be used which include: (1) refrigeration in media, (2) freeze-drying, (3) cryopreservation, (4) freezing, and (5) media storage at room temperature.

This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs’ confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p<0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450","urlToImage":""},{"title":"DNA hydrogel-empowered biosensing","source":"Advances in Colloid and Interface Science","keywords":[{"term":"DNAs","category":"Organization"},{"term":"DNAzymes","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract DNA hydrogels as special members in the DNA nanotechnology have provided crucial prerequisites to create innovative gels owing to their sufficient stability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable multifunctionality.

These two AMPs effectively inhibit the growth of human pathogenic fungi in micromolar concentrations and exhibit antiviral potential without causing cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. The antifungal mechanism of action of both AMPs is closely linked to - but not solely dependent on - the lipid composition of the fungal cell membrane and requires a strictly regulated protein uptake into the cell, indicating that PAF and PAFB are not canonical membrane active proteins. Variations in their antifungal spectrum and their killing dynamics point towards a divergent mode of action related to their physicochemical properties and surface charge distribution. In this review, we relate characteristic features of PAF and PAFB to the current knowledge about other AMPs of different sources. In addition, we present original data that have never been published before to substantiate our assumptions and provide evidences that help to explain and understand better the mechanistic function of PAF and PAFB.

Syndromes of infected people range from asymptomatic infections to severe neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper, we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET), an alkaloid isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea, was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity in vitro (i.e., in Vero and A549 cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1–4 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-Flavivirus medications.","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.012","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Emergency Caesarean delivery in a patient with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 under spinal anaesthesia","source":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1016/j.bja.2020.02.016","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Thrombocytopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A meta-analysis","source":"Clinica Chimica Acta","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Medline","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Scopus","category":"Other"},{"term":"WMD","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease.

Methods An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. Results Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31×109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29×109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48×109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39×109/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). Conclusions Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Intake and growth in transported Holstein calves classified as diarrheic or healthy within the first 21 days after arrival in a retrospective observational study","source":"Journal of Dairy Science","keywords":[{"term":"Holstein","category":"Other"},{"term":"DIA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HEA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"DMI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Initial BW","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ADG","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Intake","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HEA","category":"Nation"}],"body":"ABSTRACT Strategies that can improve health and maximize growth in the preweaning period should improve the subsequent production and longevity of replacement animals. Few data are available that quantify feed and water consumption, as well as growth, in healthy versus non-healthy calves—the objective of this study. A database of Holstein calves (<1 wk of age; n = 313) was developed to compare calves that developed diarrhea in the first 21 d after arrival from commercial farms to the research facility versus calves that remained healthy. Individual calf data from 4 experiments included daily intake of milk replacer, free water, electrolyte solution, and starter grain, as well as weekly body weight (BW) and frame measures for 21 d after arrival. Calves with a fecal score of >2 for ≥3 consecutive days over the first 21 d of each experiment were retrospectively classified as diarrheic (DIA; n = 96); the remainder were classified as healthy (HEA; n = 217). Other health issues were minimal. The likelihood of elevated fecal score occurrence and the cumulative number of days with an elevated score were greater for DIA calves than for HEA calves. The initial total protein concentration in blood did not differ between classifications. Cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake (DMI) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves, because DIA calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer. Cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves. As a result, cumulative total DMI was significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves. Cumulative free water intake did not differ between classifications. The DIA calves were more likely to receive electrolyte solution and have more days given electrolyte solution than HEA calves. As a result, total cumulative intake of electrolyte solution was greater in DIA calves than in HEA calves. Cumulative total water intake did not differ between classifications. Initial BW did not differ between classifications; however, a classification × time interaction for BW indicated that HEA calves were heavier than DIA calves and had greater ADG. Significant classification × time interactions for hip height and heart girth revealed that HEA calves had a larger frame size. Gain–feed ratios for both milk replacer intake and total DMI differed between classifications: DIA calves were less feed-efficient than HEA calves. In conclusion, diarrhea in young calves decreases DMI, BW gain, and feed efficiency relative to HEA calves within 21 d of arrival.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.3168/jds.2019-16609","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effect of antibiotic treatment in preweaned Holstein calves after experimental bacterial challenge with Pasteurella multocida","source":"Journal of Dairy Science","keywords":[{"term":"Pasteurella","category":"Other"},{"term":"Holstein","category":"Other"},{"term":"Lung US","category":"Other"},{"term":"PME","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CON","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Holstein","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CON","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wisconsin","category":"Nation"}],"body":"ABSTRACT The primary objective of this randomized controlled challenge study was to investigate the effect of ampicillin on ultrasonographic (US) lung consolidation after experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida in preweaned dairy calves.

Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.3168/jds.2019-16992","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Comparison of oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous fluid therapy for resuscitation of calves with diarrhea","source":"Journal of Dairy Science","keywords":[{"term":"OES","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Ringer","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SC fluid","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Holstein","category":"Other"},{"term":"Diarrhea","category":"Other"},{"term":"Comparison","category":"Other"}],"body":"ABSTRACT Neonatal diarrhea remains the primary cause of mortality in dairy calves around the world, and optimal treatment protocols are needed. The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.3168/jds.2019-16970","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Associations between maternal characteristics and health, survival, and performance of dairy heifers from birth through first lactation","source":"Journal of Dairy Science","keywords":[{"term":"Holstein","category":"Other"},{"term":"Prim","category":"Other"},{"term":"Mult","category":"Other"},{"term":"Mult-NoCD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mult","category":"Organization"}],"body":"ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to investigate whether health, survival, and performance of dairy heifers from birth through first lactation are associated with parity and health status of their dams.

The objective of this study was to identify pathogen-specific risk factors associated with epidemic respiratory disease in calves. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 128 outbreaks (29 dairy, 58 dairy-mixed, and 41 beef) in Belgium (2016–2018). A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75/128) and 13.3% (17/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1–7.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0–1.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2–11.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8–37.5)]}. Other factors associated with bRSV were PI-3 detection [OR = 13.4 (2.1–86.0)], prevalence of calves with respiratory disease [OR = 1.02 (1.00–1.04) per 1% increase], and number of days with respiratory signs before sampling [OR = 0.99 (0.98–0.99) per day increase]. Next to its association with BCV, M. haemolytica was more frequently detected in herds with 5 to 10 animals per pen [OR = 8.0 (1.4–46.9)] compared with <5 animals, and in herds with sawdust as bedding [OR = 18.3 (1.8–191.6)]. Also, for H. somni, housing on sawdust was a risk factor [OR = 5.2 (1.2–23.0)]. Purchase of cattle [OR = 2.9 (1.0–8.0)] and housing of recently purchased animals in the same airspace [OR = 5.0 (1.5–16.5)] were risk factors for M. bovis. This study identified pathogen-specific risk factors that might be useful for the development of customized control and prevention and for the design of decision support tools to justify antimicrobial use by predicting the most likely pathogen before sampling results are available.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.3168/jds.2019-17486","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Interpretive Summaries, March 2020","source":"Journal of Dairy Science","keywords":[{"term":"Summaries","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/S0022-0302(20)30113-2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Anticancer activity studies of novel metal complexes of ligands derived from polycyclic aromatic compound via greener route","source":"Journal of Organometallic Chemistry","keywords":[{"term":"Methoxy","category":"Other"},{"term":"MCF–7","category":"Other"},{"term":"Schiff","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NMR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GC–MS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TGA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"L1H","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Methoxy and tert-butyl substituted carboxamide, carboxylic acid and hydrazone Schiff base groups have been assembled into our newly designed fluorenone based ligands and prepared coordination compounds of some first row transition metals and characterized thoroughly with spectroscopic (1H and 13C NMR, IR, GC–MS, UV–Vis), analytical, TGA and molar conductance measurements.

These measures are responses to the limits on what Beijing can do under the “one country, two systems” model. As Beijing cannot send the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has subverted Hong Kong's once-respected civilian police force to act like the mainland's public security. And as Hong Kong's judiciary is relatively autonomous and many of the arrested would not be convicted or sentenced, the police have resorted to a decapacitation campaign to inflict direct violence on protesters. Moreover, as the city's freedom has allowed the public to support protesters in various ways, Beijing has launched a program of dismissal of pro-democracy individuals in both public and private sectors.

At day 11, broilers were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Five days later, all broilers were euthanized and cecal content was examined for C. jejuni colonization. No decrease in C. jejuni colonization was found. The freeze-drying resulted in a 16-fold decrease of the antibody titer in the yolk powder compared to the fresh yolks, presumably caused by structural changes in the antibodies.

In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian® X is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001).

CPEs provide naked eye detection possibility by their superior optical properties however, as concentration of target analytes decrease, trace amounts of nucleic acid typically yield colorimetric responses that are not readily perceivable by naked eye. Herein, we report a pixelated analysis approach for correlating colorimetric responses of CPE with nucleic acid concentrations down to 1 nM, in plasma samples, utilizing a smart phone with an algorithm that can perform analytical testing and data processing. The detection strategy employed relies on conformational transitions between single stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes and double stranded nucleic acid-CPE triplexes that yield distinct colorimetric responses for enabling naked eye detection of nucleic acids. Cationic poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide] is utilized as the CPE reporter deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for nucleic acid assay. A smart phone application is developed to capture and digitize the colorimetric response of the individual pixels of the digital images of CPE on the PVDF membrane, followed by an analysis using the algorithm. The proposed pixelated approach enables precise quantification of nucleic acid assay concentrations, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses, for instance, RGB analysis. The obtained results illustrate that a ubiquitous smart phone could be utilized for point of care colorimetric nucleic acids assays in complex matrices without requiring sophisticated software or instrumentation.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120581","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Correlation between electrical properties and cation distribution in [(Ni x Mn1- x )0.84Cu0.16]3O4 thin films prepared by metal-organic decomposition for microbolometer applications","source":"Thin Solid Films","keywords":[{"term":"Nix Mn","category":"Other"},{"term":"Mn4+/Mn3","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TCR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract [(Nix Mn 1- x )0.84Cu 0.16]3O4 (0.20 ≤ x ≤ 0.40) thin films have been prepared using the metal-organic decomposition method for microbolometer applications.

Here, differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified as responses to environmental stresses in the economically important sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, and their potential roles were explored. Based on a total of 159, 355 and 495 significantly upregulated genes and 230, 518 and 647 significantly downregulated genes identified in the thermal, hypoxic and combination thermal + hypoxic stress treatments, respectively, we constructed DE-lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks.

The Ub system displays significant crosstalk with structurally homologous ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls), including SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15. This can be seen with the existence of heterogeneous chains made from Ub–Ubl mixtures as well as the proteolytic cross reactivity displayed by several DUBs toward other Ubl systems.

An array of available deubiquitinase substrates for biochemical characterization are presented and their limitations as standalone tools are discussed. Methods for the determination and analysis of deubiquitinase structure are also presented, with a focus on visualizing recognition of the ubiquitin substrate.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/bs.mie.2019.01.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Decreased expression of type I (IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ) interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps","source":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","keywords":[{"term":"CRS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TLR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TH1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Interferon","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ISG","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background Little is known about antiviral responses in the sinonasal mucosal tissue of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Objective we investigated the presence of virus and the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects and the inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients, and evaluated whether levels of interferons and ISGs might be affected by CRS-related cytokines and by treatment with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists. Methods The presence of virus in the sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR. The expression of interferons and ISGs in the sinonasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells treated with TH1 and TH2 cytokines, macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in the sinonasal mucosa were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 15% of samples. Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. Conclusion These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells. Macrolides and glucocorticoids might provide positive effects on the treatment of CRS by upregulating interferon and ISG expression.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jaci.2019.08.010","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sulfolipid-1 Activates Nociceptive Neurons and Induces Cough","source":"Cell","keywords":[{"term":"Summary","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pulmonary","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Mycobacterium","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SL-1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Sulfolipid-1 Activates Nociceptive Neurons and Induces Cough","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mtb-infected","category":"Other"}],"body":"Summary Pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), manifests with a persistent cough as both a primary symptom and mechanism of transmission.

However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026","urlToImage":""},{"title":"CRISPR in livestock: From editing to printing","source":"Theriogenology","keywords":[{"term":"CRISPR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Precise genome editing of large animals applied to livestock and biomedicine is nowadays possible since the CRISPR revolution.

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Department of Error","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Department of Error","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30638-3","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Understanding the penetrance of intrinsic protein disorder in rotavirus proteome","source":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","keywords":[{"term":"Rotavirus","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IDPs)/(IDPRs","category":"Nation"},{"term":"NSP4","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MoRFs","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Rotavirus is a major cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in the infants and young children.

Here, we cloned the duck KPNA4 (duKPNA4) gene and analyzed its involvement in type I IFN expression as well as antiviral response against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The full-length duKPNA4 gene encoded a 520-amino acid protein that shared 97.3–98.7% sequence similarity with its orthologues in chickens, humans and mice. The duKPNA4 was extensively expressed in various duck tissues at the mRNA level. Analysis of the subcellular localization of duKPNA4 by immunofluorescence assays indicated that the duKPNA4 was primarily distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in primary duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs). However, it translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to poly(I:C) stimulation or JEV infection. The duKPNA4 interacted with duck IFN regulatory factor 7 and facilitated its nuclear translocation, thereby up-regulating the expression of IFN-α and IFN-β in DEFs in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation. Exogenous expression of duKPNA4 significantly elevated the expression of IFN-α and IFN-β induced by JEV infection and inhibited JEV replication in DEFs.

These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward. Methods We conducted a search of 2 electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, for experimental studies that involved new HIV immunogen designs between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they were written in language other than English and/or were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. Findings The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth during the last 3 decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several new rationally designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last 6 years, including native-like envelope trimers, nanoparticle, and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others. Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials.

Furthermore, PADs have been found to be a phylogenetically conserved regulator for extracellular vesicle (EVs) release. EVs are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins in serum and serum-EVs are described for the first time in camelids, using the llama (Lama glama L. 1758) as a model animal. We report a poly-dispersed population of llama serum EVs, positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by TEM. In serum, 103 deiminated proteins were overall identified, including key immune and metabolic mediators including complement components, immunoglobulin-based nanobodies, adiponectin and heat shock proteins.

Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. Results Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. Conclusion CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and their potential immune modulatory functions","source":"Pharmacology & Therapeutics","keywords":[{"term":"Dipeptidyl","category":"Other"},{"term":"DPP4is","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CD26","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (DPP4is) are oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through inhibiting the degradation of incretin peptides.

Objectives This case report and systematic review aims to synthesize the published literature on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of atypical croup. Study selection Peer-reviewed journal publications in Ovid MEDLINE® and EMBASE from inception to January 1, 2019 in English, focusing on pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with diagnoses of atypical croup. Data extraction Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Twelve studies involving 670 patients ranging from 6 months to 11 years of age presenting with atypical croup were selected. A variety of definitions of atypical croup were identified based on recurrence, duration of symptoms, severity, and etiology. Data on the incidence of atypical croup, the overall rates of intubation and tracheostomy, and patient characteristics leading to definitive airway management were not clearly characterized.

Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin’s calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm’s calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand’s pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm’s calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.","time":1580428800000,"url":"10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104836","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Importance of colostrum IgG antibodies level for prevention of infection with Cryptosporidium parvum in neonatal dairy calves","source":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"Cryptosporidium","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Cryptosporidiosis is one of the most common zoonosis worldwide, causing intestinal infection to both humans and livestock. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the level of anti-C. parvum IgG antibodies transferred through colostrum from dams to newborn calves impacts the susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis. A number of 50 dams and their healthy newborns were included in the study. Colostrum samples were collected within 12 h after birth and anti-C. parvum IgG antibody levels were determined by single radial immunodiffusion. The health condition of the newborns was daily monitored, and fecal samples were collected at first diarrheic episode of a calf. In all dams, the anti-C. parvum IgG antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 570 and 4070 mg/dl; in dams who gave birth to calves with diarrhea and were C. parvum-positive, the antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 680 and 3680 mg/dl (Table 1). The point-biserial correlation showed a negative correlation between the levels of anti-C. parvum antibodies and manifestation of clinical cryptosporidiosis (r=-0.425). Our findings highlight the importance of IgG levels in colostrum received by neonatal calves during their first day of life for prevention of C. parvum infection.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.104904","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Socioeconomic, geographic and climatic risk factors for canine parvovirus infection and euthanasia in Australia","source":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"CPV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CPV-","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Index of Relative","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Australia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"–0.3762","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Socioeconomic Disadvantage","category":"Other"},{"term":"0.0001","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Infection of canids with canine parvovirus (CPV) can result in severe, often fatal disease.

Severe caseloads (>40 cases per annum) were reported by 26 (11 %) hospitals (median 60 cases; IQR 50–110). Case reporting, case numbers, and without-treatment euthanasia were significantly associated with disadvantage across all Socio-Economic Index for Areas quintiles (p < 0.0001) – the greater the disadvantage, the more reports.

Crucial to halting PDCoV transmission and infection is the development of effective therapies and vaccines. The spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the major target of host neutralizing antibodies, however the immunodominant neutralizing region in the S protein of PDCoV has not been defined. Here, three truncations of the PDCoV S protein were generated, the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (NTD, amino acids (aa) 50–286), the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (CTD, aa 278–616), and S2 subunit (aa 601–1087). The proteins were expressed using an E. coli expression system. Polyclonal antisera against the three recombinant proteins were produced in rabbits and mice. All three antisera were able to inhibit PDCoV infection in vitro, as determined by virus neutralization assay, fluorescent focus neutralization assay, and plaque-reduction neutralization. The CTD-specific antisera had the most potent PDCoV-neutralizing effect, indicating that the CTD region may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) in the PDCoV S protein.

As disasters, health, and infectious disease become part of planning concern (Matthew & McDonald, 2007), greater focus on household infrastructure and EID disease outbreaks among poultry is warranted. Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed “coherence indices” (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation. Findings also suggest that community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures is a powerful tool for predicting where HPAI poultry outbreaks are likely to occur, thereby providing health planners new tools for efficient surveillance.","time":1580428800000,"url":"10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease","source":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","keywords":[{"term":"Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.cvsm.2019.10.009","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Multiplex PCR implementation as point of care testing in a French Emergency Department","source":"Journal of Hospital Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Emergency Department","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1580774400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.021","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effects of environmental disinfection on the isolation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus after a hospital-associated outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","source":"American Journal of Infection Control","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Enterococcus","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Environmental disinfection with sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide vapor was performed after a hospital-associated outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome.

These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care–associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients’ families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middle-income country), and South Korea (high-income country). Methods The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. Results Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries’ guidelines. Conclusions Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice.

In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models.

In this review, we comprehensively summarize the biological activity and SAR for pyrazolone analogues, wishing to give an overall retrospect and prospect on the pyrazolone derivatives.","time":1579046400000,"url":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111893","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Therapeutic significance of β-glucuronidase activity and its inhibitors: A review","source":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","keywords":[],"body":"Abstract The emergence of disease and dearth of effective pharmacological agents on most therapeutic fronts, constitutes a major threat to global public health and man’s existence. Consequently, this has created an exigency in the search for new drugs with improved clinical utility or means of potentiating available ones. To this end, accumulating empirical evidence supports molecular target therapy as a plausible egress and, β-glucuronidase (βGLU) – a lysosomal acid hydrolase responsible for the catalytic deconjugation of β-d-glucuronides has emerged as a viable molecular target for several therapeutic applications. The enzyme’s activity level in body fluids is also deemed a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of some pathological conditions. Moreover, due to its role in colon carcinogenesis and certain drug-induced dose-limiting toxicities, the development of potent inhibitors of βGLU in human intestinal microbiota has aroused increased attention over the years. Nevertheless, although our literature survey revealed both natural products and synthetic scaffolds as potential inhibitors of the enzyme, only few of these have found clinical utility, albeit with moderate to poor pharmacokinetic profile. Hence, in this review we present a compendium of exploits in the present millennium directed towards the inhibition of βGLU. The aim is to proffer a platform on which new scaffolds can be modelled for improved βGLU inhibitory potency and the development of new therapeutic agents in consequential.","time":1580515200000,"url":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111921","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Identification of 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin as a potent inhibitor of chikungunya virus replication","source":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Zika","category":"Virus"},{"term":"ZIKV","category":"Other"},{"term":"Chikungunya","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Selectfluor","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SAH","category":"Nation"},{"term":"CHIKV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"5′-phosphorylation","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SAH","category":"Organization"},{"term":"μM.","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract We have reported on aristeromycin (1) and 6′-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues (2), which are active against RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5′-phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6′-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5′-phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6′-fluorinated-5′-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6′-β-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC50 = 0.36 μM). Among the compounds tested, 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.12 μM) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 μM. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 μM, respectively), which suggested that 3a’s antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV. The potent inhibition and high selectivity index make 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) a promising new template for the development of antivirals against CHIKV, a serious re-emerging pathogen that has infected millions of people over the past 15 years.","time":1580515200000,"url":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111956","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Discovery, synthesis, and optimization of an N-alkoxy indolylacetamide against HIV-1 carrying NNRTI-resistant mutations from the Isatis indigotica root","source":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"NNRTI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NVP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"EFV (EC50 =","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HIV-1","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract From an aqueous decoction of the traditional Chinese medicine “ban lan gen” (the Isatis indigotica root), an antiviral natural product CI - 39 was isolated as an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) (EC50 = 3.40 μM).

Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46–0.51). Conclusions Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.","time":1578614400000,"url":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.005","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Attenuated live infectious bronchitis virus QX vaccine disseminates slowly to target organs distant from the site of inoculation","source":"Vaccine","keywords":[{"term":"IBV-QX","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IB Primo QX","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IBV-D388","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IBV D388","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Nephropathogenic IBVs","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of poultry, caused by the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Currently, one of the most relevant genotypes circulating worldwide is IBV-QX (GI-19), for which vaccines have been developed by passaging virulent QX strains in embryonated chicken eggs. Here we explored the attenuated phenotype of a commercially available QX live vaccine, IB Primo QX, in specific pathogens free broilers. At hatch, birds were inoculated with QX vaccine or its virulent progenitor IBV-D388, and postmortem swabs and tissues were collected each day up to eight days post infection to assess viral replication and morphological changes. In the trachea, viral RNA replication and protein expression were comparable in both groups. Both viruses induced morphologically comparable lesions in the trachea, albeit with a short delay in the vaccinated birds. In contrast, in the kidney, QX vaccine viral RNA was nearly absent, which coincided with the lack of any morphological changes in this organ. This was in contrast to high viral RNA titers and abundant lesions in the kidney after IBV D388 infection. Furthermore, QX vaccine showed reduced ability to reach and replicate in conjunctivae and intestines including cloaca, resulting in significantly lower titers and delayed protein expression, respectively. Nephropathogenic IBVs might reach the kidney also via an ascending route from the cloaca, based on our observation that viral RNA was detected in the cloaca one day before detection in the kidney. In the kidney distal tubular segments, collecting ducts and ureter were positive for viral antigen. Taken together, the attenuated phenotype of QX vaccine seems to rely on slower dissemination and lower replication in target tissues other than the site of inoculation.","time":1580860800000,"url":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.064","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Recombinant infectious bronchitis coronavirus H120 with the spike protein S1 gene of the nephropathogenic IBYZ strain remains attenuated but induces protective immunity","source":"Vaccine","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"rH120-infected","category":"Organization"},{"term":"rH120","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious viral disease responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry.

We previously showed that plant-made recombinant immune complex (RIC) vaccines are a robust platform to improve the immunogenicity of weak antigens. In this study, we altered the antigen fusion site on the RIC platform to accommodate N-terminal fusion to the IgG heavy chain (N-RIC), and thus a wider range of antigens, with a resulting 40% improvement in RIC expression over the normal C-terminal fusion (C-RIC). Both types of RICs containing ZE3 were efficiently assembled in plants and purified to >95% homogeneity with a simple one-step purification. Both ZE3 RICs strongly bound complement receptor C1q and elicited strong ZE3-specific antibody titers that correlated with ZIKV neutralization. When either N-RIC or C-RIC was codelivered with plant-produced hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLP) displaying ZE3, the combination elicited 5-fold greater antibody titers (>1,000,000) and more strongly neutralized ZIKV than either RICs or VLPs alone, after only two doses without adjuvant. These findings demonstrate that antigens that require a free N-terminus for optimal antigen display can now be used with the RIC system, and that plant-made RICs and VLPs are highly effective vaccines targeting ZE3.

We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system’s behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasi-periodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Investigation of interunit dispersion in 2D street canyons: A scaled outdoor experiment","source":"Building and Environment","keywords":[{"term":"CFD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"C O 2","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Interunit dispersion problems have been studied previously mainly through on-site measurements, wind tunnel tests, and CFD simulations. In this study, a scaled outdoor experiment was conducted to examine the interunit dispersion characteristics in consecutive two-dimensional street canyons. Tracer gas ( C O 2 ) was continuously released to simulate the pollutant dispersion routes between the rooms in street canyons. The wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and tracer gas concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Two important parameters, the air exchange rate and reentry ratio, were analyzed to reveal the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion of the rooms in the street canyons. Based on the real-time weather conditions, it was found that the ventilation performance of the source room varied according to the room location. The air exchange rate distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. The tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction inside the street canyon, and the highest reentry ratio was observed at the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route. In addition, under real weather conditions, the rooms in the street canyon have a high probability of experiencing a high reentry ratio based on the maximum reentry ratio of each room. This study provides authentic airflow and pollutant dispersion information in the street canyons in an urban environment. The dataset of this experiment can be used to validate further numerical simulations.","time":1584230400000,"url":"10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The social-mediated crisis communication research: Revisiting dialogue between organizations and publics in crises of China","source":"Public Relations Review","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Guanxi","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract The rapid diffusion of social media is ushering in a new era of crisis communication.

It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A novel intracellularly expressed NS5B-specific nanobody suppresses bovine viral diarrhea virus replication","source":"Veterinary Microbiology","keywords":[{"term":"NS5B","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BVDV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Camellidae","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MDBK","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BVDV NS5B","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NS5B","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection causes significant economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide and still represents a huge pressure on agricultural production.

Further, the camel single-domain antibody (nanobody) represents a promising antiviral approach with the advantages of small size, stable structure, high specificity and solubility, and the recognition of specific epitopes. However, no NS5B-specific nanobodies against BVDV have been reported. In this study, NS5B-specific nanobodies were isolated from a phage display library of variable domains of Camellidae heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs).

However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model. As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay. We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot. As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay. Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals. Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age. Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS. Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively.

The results suggested that the viruses I0623/17 and I0710/17 were avian coronaviruses and were identified as pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), with greatest similarity to IBV. Further investigations of the antigenicity, complete genome organization, substitutions in multiple genes, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants showed obvious differences between PhCoV and IBV in terms of antigenicity, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants. The close genetic relationship, but obvious differences between PhCoVs and IBVs suggested the IBVs could be the ancestors of PhCoVs, and that PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks may have evolved independently from IBVs circulating in the specific region by adaption in pheasants. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the S1 gene fragments of the two PhCoVs isolated in the current study, as well as PhCoVs isolated in the UK and selected IBV strains. Such analyses indicated different evolution patterns and different tissue tropisms between PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks.

On this route, the virus is exposed to destructive fluids of the digestive tract, which are acidic and contain the proteases pepsin (gizzard) or chymotrypsin and trypsin (intestine). Only the latter enzyme activates virus by cleaving hemagglutinin (HA) into HA1 and HA2 subunits. We mimicked the passage of viruses through the gastrointestinal tract by treating them with digestive fluids from chicken and determined titers and integrity of HA by western-blot. Gizzard fluid completely inactivated virions and degrades HA even at a high dilution, but only if the pH was kept acidic. If the fluid is diluted with neutral buffer (mimicking virus uptake with seawater) particles were more resistant. Virions containing an uncleaved HA were even activated suggesting that gastric juice contains a trypsin-like protease. Undiluted intestinal fluid inactivated particles and destroyed HA, but diluted fluid activated virions. A virus isolated from the duck´s intestine is more tolerant against intestinal fluid compared to fowl plague virus suggesting that the former is better adapted to grow in the intestine. We also demonstrate that influenza viruses replicate to high titers in a novel chicken epithelial gut cell line. While viruses with a monobasic HA cleavage site require addition of trypsin, these cells effectively process HA with a polybasic cleavage site, which could be blocked with an inhibitor of the cellular furin protease.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108462","urlToImage":""},{"title":"S100A9 regulates porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication by interacting with the viral nucleocapsid protein","source":"Veterinary Microbiology","keywords":[{"term":"PRRSV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"S100","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PRRSV BB0907","category":"Organization"},{"term":"S100A9-overexpressed PAM","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PRRSV","category":"Other"},{"term":"rBB","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has caused huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide over the last 30 years, yet the associated viral-host interactions remain poorly understood.

Aims This review article documents and critically assesses, for the first time; up to date categorized information about C. serrata including its reported pharmacological activities, cultural uses, active compounds, and botanical description. Materials and method s: All provided information about C. serrata was collected using the electronic databases (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Springer Link), books (e.g. Trees of Pakistan and Herbalism, Phytochemistry, and Ethnopharmacology) and thesis. Results Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical studies on C. serrata revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as; flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and cardiac glycosides. The phytochemicals showed various in vitro activities like antioxidant, anti-infective, antiglycation, cytotoxic activities. Major areas of research conducted on C. serrata are its antioxidant and anti-infective activities. Few historical uses of C. serrata are supported by modern in vitro pharmacological studies such as; antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, and leishmanicidal activity. Conclusion There were convincing evidence in in vitro studies supporting C. serrata antioxidant, anti-infective, anti-diabetic, anti-glycating, and cytotoxic activities. Nevertheless, all reported pharmacological activities were carried out in vitro and a gap in research i.e. preclinical and clinical investigation still exists. The authors emphasize the need for future in-depth research and clinical trials to investigate C. serrata pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy and safety. The potential chemical compounds with suggestive classes may need to be isolated and pharmacological activities must be established for these compounds.

We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in the bilingual (French and German speaking) Western region of Switzerland, namely the cantons of Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, and in the French speaking part of the canton of Bern. Aim of the study To find out whether differences exist in plants used by farmers in French speaking and bilingual regions of Switzerland as compared to our earlier studies conducted in Switzerland. Additional focus was on plants that are used in diseases which commonly are treated with antimicrobials, on plants used in skin afflictions, and on plants used in animal species such as horses, for which the range of veterinary medicinal products is limited. Material and methods We conducted in 2015 semistructured interviews with 62 dialog partners, mainly cattle keeping farmers but also 18 horse keeping farmers. Of these, 41 were native French (FNS) and 21 native German speakers (GNS). Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers satisfaction) were collected. Results A total of 345 homemade remedies were reported, of which 240 contained only one plant species (Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports; HSHR). A total of 289 use reports (UR) were mentioned for the 240 HSHR, and they comprised 77 plant species belonging to 41 botanical families. Of these, 35 plant species were solely reported from FNS, 20 from GNS, and 22 from both. Taking into account earlier ethnoveterinary studies conducted in Switzerland only 10 (FNS) and 6 (GNS) plant species connected with 7% of FNS and GNS UR respectively were “unique” to the respective language group. The majority of the UR (219) was for treatment of cattle, while 38 UR were intended to treat horses. The most UR were for treatment of gastrointestinal and skin diseases. The most frequently mentioned plants were Linum usitatissimum L., Coffea L., Matricaria chamomilla L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, and Quercus robur L. for gastrointestinal diseases, and Calendula officinalis L., Hypericum perforatum L. and Sanicula europaea L. for skin afflictions. Conclusion No clear differences were found between the medicinal plants used by French native speakers and German native speakers. Several of the reported plants seem to be justified to widen the spectrum of veterinary therapeutic options in gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders in cattle and horses, and to reduce, at least to a certain degree, the need for antibiotic treatments. Our findings may help to strengthen the role of medicinal plants in veterinary research and practice, and to consider them as a further measure in official strategies for lowering the use of antibiotics.","time":1578614400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jep.2019.112184","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Antiviral effect of Chinese herbal prescription JieZe-1 on adhesion and penetration of VK2/E6E7 with herpes simplex viruses type 2","source":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Kangxi","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Candida","category":"Nation"},{"term":"VP16","category":"Nation"},{"term":"JieZe-1","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Yihuang Decoction","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Genital Herpes","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ICP4","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HVEM","category":"Organization"},{"term":"VK2/E6E7","category":"Other"},{"term":"Nectin-1","category":"Other"},{"term":"Nectin-2","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance The Chinese Herbal Prescription JieZe-1(JZ-1), added and subtracted from Yihuang Decoction, a famous formula in the 12th year of Kangxi in Qing Dynasty, has a clear effect on Genital Herpes (GH) and no obvious adverse reactions occur clinically. JZ-1 also has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis and GH in vitro and in vivo experiments. Aim of study The effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on anti-herpes simplex virus type 2(HSV-2) in vitro focusing on adhesion and penetration stages were investigated. Materials and methods A model of HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7 was developed. In order to explore JZ-1's anti-HSV-2 effect in vitro, cell morphology, ultrastructural pathology, cell viability and expression of viral glycoprotein D (gD) were assessed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of JZ-1 treatment. Then we measured the exact time required for adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into VK2/E6E7 among a series of times at room temperature and under temperature control techniques. We treated VK2/E6E7 with JZ-1, penciclovir, or berberine and explored the mechanism of JZ-1 in blocking HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of host cells by assessing the cell ultrastructural pathology, viability, viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4 and host cell proteins HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2. Results HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into VK/E6E7 within 5 mins at room temperature while it takes 60mins under temperature control techniques. JZ-1 and penciclovir showed significant anti-HSV-2 effects, with improved host cell morphologies and increased host cell viabilities observed after treatment for 24 h. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 can be detected after treatment for 6 h while that of penciclovir was not obvious until treatment for 12 h. JZ-1 showed distinct effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by significantly reducing the expression of viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4, improving cell morphology and increasing cell viability. However, these effects were not exerted via downregulated expression of membrane fusion-related proteins such as HVEM, Nectin-1, or Nectin-2. The specific anti-HSV-2 mechanism of JZ-1 need to be further explored. Conclusion The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was superior to that of penciclovir and berberine in vitro, and was mainly mediated by enhancing host cell defense and blocking adhesion and penetration of HSV-2.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jep.2019.112405","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Antiviral activity of Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products against influenza A in vitro/ovo and mechanism of action","source":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","keywords":[{"term":"Isatidis Radix","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Isatidis Radix","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Madin-Darby","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MDCK","category":"Organization"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Isatidis Radix","category":"Nation"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Isatidis Radix, the sun-dried roots of Isatis indigotica Fortune ex Lindl., is one of the most usually used traditional Chinese medicines.

Aim of the study In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. Materials and methods Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. Results Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin > goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin.

Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, however, the bioactive components of Qing Dai are unknown clearly. Aim of the study To isolate and identify the anti-IL-17A components of Qing Dai. Materials and methods Silica, RP-18 gels, and size exclusion resin were used for column chromatography to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of isolates were elucidated by NMR, MS, UV, IR spectra, and optical rotation. IL-17A protein and gene expressions were also evaluated in the Th17 cell model and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Results Two indole alkaloids, including one new indigodole D and cephalandole B, were isolated from Qing Dai. Indigodole D could inhibit IL-17A protein production during the Th17 polarization (EC50: 2.16 μg/mL) or after the polarization (EC50: 5.99 μg/mL) without cytotoxicity toward Th17 cells. Cephalandole B did not inhibit the IL-17A protein secretion. Nevertheless, both isolates notably inhibited IL-17A gene expression, especially cephalandole B, in a dose-dependent manner in Jukat cells with IL-17A luciferase reporter.

As an in-hospital preparation, JZ-1 has been used in Tongji Hospital for many years to treat various infectious diseases of the lower female genital tract, including cervicitis, vaginitis, genital herpes and condyloma acuminatum. Our previous studies have shown that JZ-1 has curative effects on Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections. Aim of the study Genital herpes is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and is mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). Current therapies can relieve symptoms in patients but do not cure or prevent the spread of the virus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection and its mechanism, which is based on autophagy induction, to provide new ideas and a basis for the study of antiviral drugs. Materials and methods Evaluation of the antiviral activity of JZ-1 was conducted by MTT assay and western blotting. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, observations through transmission electron microscopy and experiments with the recombinant lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B were used to monitor autophagic flux in VK2/E6E7 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JZ-1 regulates autophagy, western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and to detect changes in critical molecules in the pathway after the application of a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β and TNF-α, were measured with qRT-PCR. Results HSV-2 infection inhibited autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells. Further study revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by HSV-2 infection may result in the blocked autophagic flux and inhibited autophagosome and autolysosome formation. JZ-1 exhibited significant antiviral activity in the VK2/E6E7 cells, which showed increased cell vitality and reduced viral protein expression, namely, earliest virus-specific infected cell polypeptides 5 (ICP5) and glycoprotein D (gD). We found that JZ-1 treatment inhibited the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and promoted autophagy to combat HSV-2 infection, while PI3K inhibitor pretreatment prevented the enhanced autophagy induced by JZ-1. Moreover, JZ-1 attenuated the increase in inflammatory cytokines that had been induced HSV-2 infection. Conclusion Our results showed that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 infection, and this beneficial effect may be mediated by inducing autophagy via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jep.2020.112611","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Molecular testing for respiratory pathogens in sickle cell disease adult patients presenting with febrile acute chest syndrome","source":"Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses","keywords":[{"term":"ACS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CAP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SCD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NAAT","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"},{"term":"K. pneumoniae","category":"Other"},{"term":"M. pneumoniae","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Background Differentiating acute chest syndrome (ACS) from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is challenging in adults presenting with major sickle cell disease (SCD) (semiological similarity, rare microbiological documentation).

Methods We performed a prospective, monocentric, observational study of 61 SCD adults presenting with febrile ACS from February 2015 to April 2016. Systematic blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were collected, before antibiotic initiation, for culture, urinary antigen tests, serology, and NAAT for respiratory pathogens.

Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and B. anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and probiotics. However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.micpath.2019.103675","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Immunohistochemical and molecular detection of natural cases of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus infection causing enteritis in dairy calves","source":"Microbial Pathogenesis","keywords":[{"term":"BRoV","category":"Location"},{"term":"BCoV","category":"Other"},{"term":"Peyer","category":"Other"},{"term":"BRoV","category":"Nation"},{"term":"India","category":"Nation"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IHC","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Bovine rotavirus (BRoV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calve diarrhoea.

In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-ĸB, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats.","time":1582329600000,"url":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.02.009","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Designing self-assembled peptide nanovaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae: An in silico strategy","source":"Molecular and Cellular Probes","keywords":[{"term":"PPV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PCV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CTL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HTL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"DTD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Streptococcus","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Diphtheria","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main cause of diseases such as meningitis, pneumoniae and sepsis, especially in children and old people. Due to costly antibiotic treatment, and increasing resistance of pneumococcus, developing high-efficient protective vaccine against this pathogen is an urgent need. Although the pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and pneumonia conjugate vaccines (PCV) are the efficient pneumococcal vaccine in children and adult groups, but the serotype replacement of S. pneumoniae strains causes the reduction in efficacy of such vaccines. For overcoming the aforesaid drawbacks epitope-based vaccines are introduced as the relevant alternative. In our previous research, the epitope vaccine was designed based on immunodominant epitopes from PspA, CbpA antigens as cellular stimulants and PhtD, PiuA as humoral stimulants. Because the low immunogenicity is the main disadvantage of epitope vaccine, in the current study, we applied coiled-coil self-assembled structures for developing our vaccine. Recently, self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) have gained much attention in the field of vaccine development due to their multivalency, self-adjuvanticity, biocompatibility, and size similarity to pathogen. In this regard, the final designed vaccine is comprised of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes from PspA and CbpA, helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes from PhtD and PiuA, the pentamer and trimmer oligomeric domains form 5-stranded and 3-stranded coiled-coils as self-assembled scaffold, Diphtheria toxoids (DTD) as a universal T-helper, which fused to each other with appropriate linkers. The four different arrangements based on the order of above-mentioned compartments were constructed, and each of them were modeled, and validated to find the 3D structure.

In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–5.57, P =0.02). Conclusion Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection.","time":1580428800000,"url":"10.1016/j.arcped.2019.11.006","urlToImage":""},{"title":"An efficient pattern growth approach for mining fault tolerant frequent itemsets","source":"Expert Systems with Applications","keywords":[{"term":"Apriori","category":"Nation"},{"term":"PatternGrowth","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets from transactional databases are computationally more expensive than mining exact matching frequent itemsets.

Apriori-like algorithms generate exponential number of candidate itemsets including the itemsets that do not exist in the database. These algorithms require multiple scans of database for counting the support of candidate FT itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, which mines FT frequent itemsets using frequent pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). The support of candidate itemsets are counted directly from the FP-tree without scanning the original database multiple times. This improves the processing speed of algorithm. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicates mining FT frequent itemsets using FT-PatternGrowth is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms.","time":1585699200000,"url":"10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046","urlToImage":""},{"title":"cGAS and CD-NTase enzymes: structure, mechanism, and evolution","source":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","keywords":[{"term":"Cyclic GMP–AMP","category":"Other"},{"term":"cGAS","category":"Other"},{"term":"immunity.cGAS","category":"Other"},{"term":"Vibrio","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) is a signaling enzyme in human cells that controls immune-sensing of cytosolic DNA.

To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player’s own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network.

Thirty-one patients (46.3%) with IPS died within the first 120 days of HCT and 47 patients (70.1%) died within 365 days of HCT. In contrast, among the 1762 patients who did not acquire IPS in the first 120 days, 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Our findings suggest that although the incidence of IPS may be declining, it remains associated with post-transplant mortality. Future study should focus on early detection and identifying pathologic mediators of IPS to facilitate timely, targeted therapies for those most susceptible to lung injury post-HCT.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.09.034","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Cellular evasion strategies of Helicobacter pylori in regulating its intracellular fate","source":"Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology","keywords":[{"term":"Helicobacter","category":"Other"},{"term":"Helicobacter","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Helicobacter pylori colonizes human stomach mucosa and its infection causes gastrointestinal diseases with variable severity.

Pathogenic bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Histophilus somni (Hs), and Mycoplasma bovis) and a range of viruses (bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine herpesvirus type 1) are associated with this complex. As most of these pathogens can be present in healthy and diseased calves, simple detection of their presence in diseased calves carries low predictive value. In other multi-agent diseases of livestock, quantification of pathogens has added substantially to the predictive value of microbiological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of two recently developed quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits (Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V) to detect and quantify these bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Test efficiencies of the qPCR assays, based on nucleic acid dilution series of target bacteria and viruses, were 93–106% and 91–104%, respectively, with assay detection limits of 10–50 copies of nucleic acids. All 44 strains of target bacteria were correctly identified, with no false positive reactions in 135strains of non-target bacterial species. Based on standard curves of log10 CFU versus cycle threshold (Ct) values, quantification was possible over a 5-log range of bacteria. In 92 tracheal aspirate samples, the kappa values for agreement between Pneumo4B and bacterial culture were 0.64-0.84 for Mh, Pm and Hs. In an additional 84 tracheal aspirates, agreement between Pneumo4B or Pneumo 4V and certified diagnostic qPCR assays was moderate (0.57) for M. bovis and high (0.71–0.90) for viral pathogens.

Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only 6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely to have received vaccination. In temporary shelters immunization coverage is >95% and the refugee population is receptive to vaccination.

Sources We have reviewed the reports and studies provided by the governmental and non-governmental organizations and obtained more detailed data from the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Content Between 2012 and 2016, 1 299 209 cases of respiratory tract infection and 158 058 episodes of diarrhoea with 59 bloody diarrhoeas were reported; 1354 hepatitis A cases and 108 active tuberculosis cases were detected and treated in the temporary shelters for Syrian refugees. Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. Implications Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or sexually transmitted infections. The Syrian refugees can be considered as a vulnerable group in Turkey due to their living and working conditions.

Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, β2-adrenoceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to universal coverage in both primary and hospital care. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine. Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Human Papillomavirus and carcinogenesis: Novel mechanisms of cell communication involving extracellular vesicles","source":"Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews","keywords":[{"term":"Extracellular Vesicles","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Papillomavirus","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract A small group of mucosal Human Papillomaviruses are the causative agents of cervical cancer and are also associated with other types of cancers.

Considering the availability of the RSV vaccines in the coming years, molecular understanding in RSV is necessary. Objective The objective of the present study was to describe RSV epidemiology and genotype variability in Portugal during the 2014/15-2017/18 period. Material and methods Epidemiological data and RSV-positive samples from patients with a respiratory infection were collected through the non-sentinel and sentinel influenza surveillance system (ISS). RSV detection, subtyping in A and B, and sequencing of the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of G gene were performed by molecular methods. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and p-distance model on MEGA 7.0. Results RSV prevalence varied between the sentinel (2.5%, 97/3891) and the non-sentinel ISS (20.7%, 3138/16779), being higher (P < 0.0001) among children aged <5 years. Bronchiolitis (62.9%, 183/291) and influenza-like illness (24.6%, 14/57) were associated (P < 0.0001) with RSV laboratory confirmation among children aged <6 months and adults ≥65 years, respectively. The HVR2 was sequenced for 562 samples.

To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. Methods We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. Findings In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286–873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65·4% decrease, 61·5–68·5) and in mortality rate (from 362·7 deaths [330·1–392·0] per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths [109·8–128·3] per 100 000 children; 67·2% decrease, 63·5–70·1). LRI incidence declined globally (32·4% decrease, 27·2–37·5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11·4% decrease, 0·0–24·5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6·3% decrease, 6·1–6·3), and reductions in household air pollution (8·4%, 6·8–9·2). Interpretation Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

The life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the disease it is important to predict the impact of environmental scenarios on spore concentration and infection prevalence. Here, we introduce a model based on partial differential equations to study the spore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. The analysis of the model shows that for current climate conditions, additional dam release can reduce the actinospore concentration up to 48% and the prevalence up to 40% thus providing a potential disease management option. However, the infection risk is likely to increase for future climate conditions by 10–54% and this will lead to an infection level comparable to that of a recent high-disease year. Our simulations show that dam removal cannot be assumed to mitigate the effect of climate change or to have influence on infection prevalence. We show that our detailed model system can be reduced to a simpler exponential dose-response function, which predicts infection levels based on transmission rates, travel time and mean spore concentration, quantities that can be measured in-situ or given empirically. The dose-response function may therefore be a useful tool in disease management.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.100776","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections at the 2017 Grand Magal de Touba, Senegal: A prospective cohort survey","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Touba","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Senegal","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Senegal","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Streptococcus","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Escherichia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Grand Magal de Touba","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Haemophilus","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Grand Magal","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Background The Grand Magal of Touba is the largest Muslim pilgrimage in Senegal with a potential for infectious disease transmission.

This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider. Conclusions Despite this surveillance being limited to patients presenting to GeoSentinel sites, our findings highlight the importance of respiratory diseases at mass gatherings, the need for pre-travel consultations before mass gatherings, and consideration of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101504","urlToImage":""},{"title":"MERS-CoV as an emerging respiratory illness: A review of prevention methods","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Embase","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"PubMed","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Healthcare","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Preventive","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Cochrane","category":"Other"},{"term":"Scopus","category":"Other"},{"term":"Google Scholar","category":"Other"},{"term":"syndrome’","category":"Other"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract Introduction Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Virus (MERS-CoV) first emerged from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since been recognized as a significant human respiratory pathogen on a global level. Methods In this narrative review, we focus on the prevention of MERS-CoV. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the following terms: ‘MERS’, ‘MERS-CoV’, ‘Middle East respiratory syndrome’ in combination with ‘prevention’ or ‘infection control’. We also reviewed the references of each article to further include other studies or reports not identified by the search. Results As of Nov 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were diagnosed mostly from Middle Eastern regions with a mortality rate of at least 35%. A major outbreak that occurred outside the Middle East (in South Korea) and infections reported from 27 countries. MERS-CoV has gained recognition as a pathogen of global significance. Prevention of MERS-CoV infection is a global public health priority. Healthcare facility transmission and by extension community transmission, the main amplifier of persistent outbreaks, can be prevented through early identification and isolation of infected humans. While MERS-CoV vaccine studies were initially hindered by multiple challenges, recent vaccine development for MERS-CoV is showing promise. Conclusions The main factors leading to sustainability of MERS-CoV infection in high risk courtiers is healthcare facility transmission. MERS-CoV transmission in healthcare facility mainly results from laps in infection control measures and late isolation of suspected cases. Preventive measures for MERS-CoV include disease control in camels, prevention of camel to human transmission.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101520","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Global commercial passenger airlines and travel health information regarding infection control and the prevention of infectious disease: What's in a website?","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Conclusions Airline","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Background Air travel has never been easier, cheaper or faster, with large volumes of people travelling around the world. These factors increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Little is known, however, about the extent to which airlines provide information to passengers on infection control and measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined the websites of the global commercial passenger airlines to see if they contained information about infection control and prevention of infectious diseases and appraised the clinical usefulness of that information. Method A cross-sectional text-based analysis of the 73 airline websites from the six global commercial passenger airline conglomerates was performed to identify information about infection control and prevention of infectious between July and August 2019. Results Of the 73 airline websites, less than half (n = 35, 28.6%) contained information deemed useful for passengers. While there was a range of general health advice within the websites, there was limited information about infection control and preventing infectious diseases. A minority of websites contained information about vaccination status prior to travel, and to a lesser extent handwashing and hand hygiene, with very few including disease-specific advice or preventive measures. Conclusions Airline websites are an underutilised source of information for infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases. Providing passengers with information on basic infection control and prevention measures may support the global efforts against the spread of infectious diseases.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101528","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Two measles clusters in connection with short inner-European air travels indicating impediments to effective measles control: A cluster analysis","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Berlin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Germany","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Bavaria","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Denmark","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Sweden","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Importation and transmission of measles via air travel is a public health concern to countries, which are close to or have achieved elimination, i.e., to the majority of countries in Europe.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses.

The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus.

Probable cases were residents presenting at least 1 respiratory symptom or 1 constitutional symptom. Confirmed cases identified in the same way as probable cases but with a positive RT-PCR test for hMPV. Controls were residents with no symptoms of respiratory infection. Measures Identification of hMPV was realized on nasal swab samples by RT-PCR. Results Seventy-eight older people were resident at the time of the outbreak. Three of the 4 tested were positive for hMPV by RT-PCR and negative for 13 other viruses or bacteria. All probable infected residents presented cough; other symptoms were scarcer. An inflammatory response was present, with median C-reactive protein at 50 mg/L. The median duration of the illness was 7 days. The rate of infection among residents was high (51%), with 5 hospitalizations (12.5%) and 1 death (2.5%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination against influenza virus appeared to emerge as associated with a probable hMPV infection, but this might be an artifact, as the proportion of unvaccinated residents was low (15%). A clear infected population profile was hard to define, although limited autonomy and low ADL score may play a role. Basic hygiene precautions were reinforced, but droplet precautions seemed difficult to apply rigorously to this population.

We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using χ2. Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016‒2017, 2017‒2018, and 2018‒2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the etiology of NHAP was considered to be similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This belief was reflected in CAP guidelines until 2005 when the designation healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP was introduced and nursing home residents were included in the HCAP category. Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the “antibiotic time out” protocol. The oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens recommended for treatment of NHAP in this report are based on limited information because there are no randomized controlled trials to define the optimum regimen. In conclusion, most residents with pneumonia can be treated successfully in the nursing home. However, there is an urgent need for a specific NHAP diagnosis and treatment guideline that will give providers guidance in the management of this infection in the nursing home.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jamda.2020.01.012","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Long-Term Care Facilities and the Coronavirus Epidemic: Practical Guidelines for a Population at Highest Risk","source":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","keywords":[{"term":"Long-Term Care Facilities","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1016/j.jamda.2020.03.004","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Exogenous lipoid pneumonia in children: A systematic review","source":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","keywords":[{"term":"ELP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Design Systematic","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mycobacterium","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Preventive","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mycobacterium","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Objectives To describe the clinical-radiological-pathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of children with suspected exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP).

The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared. Results A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N = 311) had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p = 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection (p = 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.019) than those with negative viral detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single viral infection; however, there were no significant differences in duration of fever, antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between these two groups. The most commonly identified virus was human rhinovirus. About 27% (n = 83) of patients had multiple viral infections. Overall, the highest percentage of human bocavirus infection was detected in multiple viral infections (79%).

Results Among the 59 endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from 51 adult patients, FilmArray PP was effective in detecting respiratory bacterial pathogens with an overall positive percent agreement of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5–97.9%) and negative percent agreement of 97.4% (95% CI, 96.0–98.4%). FilmArray PP semi-quantitative reporting demonstrated a concordance rate of 53.6% for the culture-positive specimens and 86.3% for the culture-negative specimens. FilmArray PP detected 16 viral targets, whereas the conventional viral isolation failed, except influenza A, which showed 100% concordance with PCR. Coinfections were detected in 42.3% of the specimens. Substantial discrepancies were observed in identifying antimicrobial resistance gene targets and in the susceptibility testing. However, FilmArray PP may still be useful at the early stage of pneumonia before culture and susceptibility test reports are available.

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p <0.01). Conclusions Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them. Although our data may be incomplete and must be interpreted with caution, inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases is a serious problem which might sabotage efforts to contain the virus.","time":1584144000000,"url":"10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Caracterización clínica y etiológica de los casos de parotiditis en un servicio de urgencias","source":"Anales de Pediatría","keywords":[{"term":"Caracterización","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1577318400000,"url":"10.1016/j.anpedi.2019.11.004","urlToImage":""},{"title":"JOGC Guidelines index English","source":"Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada","keywords":[{"term":"JOGC Guidelines","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1580428800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jogc.2019.11.010","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Viral infections and multiple sclerosis","source":"Drug Discovery Today: Disease Models","keywords":[{"term":"Epstein Barr","category":"Other"},{"term":"Human Herpesvirus 6","category":"Organization"}],"body":"The etiology and pathogenesis of MS is likely to involve multiple factors interacting with each other, and the role of infectious and viral agents is still under debate, however a consistent amount of studies suggests that some viruses are associated with the disease.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.epidem.2019.100356","urlToImage":""},{"title":"2020 year of the nurse and midwife: Meeting new challenges","source":"International Emergency Nursing","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1584144000000,"url":"10.1016/j.ienj.2020.100848","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus et professionnels de santé au travail","source":"Archives des Maladies Professionnelles et de l'Environnement","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.admp.2020.02.002","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Quantitative label-free proteomic analysis reveals differentially expressed proteins in the digestive juice of resistant versus susceptible silkworm strains and their predicted impacts on BmNPV infection","source":"Journal of Proteomics","keywords":[{"term":"BmNPV","category":"Nation"},{"term":"A35","category":"Nation"},{"term":"P50","category":"Nation"},{"term":"P50","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a major pathogen causing severe economic loss. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection. Signifcance: Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is highly pathogenic, which has a great impact on the sericulture. BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice. The DEPs were identified in the digestive juices of different resistant strains following BmNPV infection, and screened out some proteins potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. Three important differentially expression proteins were validated by independent approaches. These findings uncover the potential role of silkworm digestive juice in providing resistance to BmNPV and supplemented the profile of the proteome of the digestive juices in B. mori.","time":1578268800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jprot.2019.103527","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP) framework: Progress challenges in improving influenza preparedness response capacities in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2014–2017","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"},{"term":"the Eastern Mediterranean Region","category":"Location"},{"term":"Laboratory","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Surveillance (L&S","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Afghanistan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Djibouti","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Egypt","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Jordan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Lebanon","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Morocco","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Yemen","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Influenza viruses with pandemic potential have been detected in humans in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework aims to improve the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and increase access of developing countries to vaccines and other life-saving products during a pandemic. Under the Framework, countries have been supported to enhance their capacities to detect, prepare for and respond to pandemic influenza. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, seven countries are priority countries for Laboratory and Surveillance (L&S) support: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Yemen. During 2014–2017, US$ 2.7 million was invested in regional capacity-building and US$ 4.6 million directly in the priority countries. Countries were supported to strengthen influenza diagnostic capacities to improve detection, enhance influenza surveillance systems including sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, and increase global sharing of surveillance data and influenza viruses. This paper highlights the progress made in improving influenza preparedness and response capacities in the Region from 2014 to 2017, and the challenges faced. By 2017, 18 of the 22 countries of the Region had laboratory-testing capacity, 19 had functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems and 22 had trained national rapid response teams. The number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the WHO external quality assurance panel increased from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017, and the number sharing influenza viruses with WHO collaborating centres increased by 75% (from eight to 14 countries); more than half now share influenza data with regional or global surveillance platforms. Seven countries have estimated influenza disease burden and seven have introduced influenza vaccination for high-risk groups. Challenges included: protracted complex emergencies faced by nine countries which hindered implementation of influenza surveillance in areas with the most needs, high staff turnover, achieving timely virus sharing and limited utilization of influenza data where they are available to inform vaccine policies or establish threshold values to measure the start and severity of influenza seasons.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2019.03.006","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Diagnostic delays in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus patients and health systems","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Poisson","category":"Organization"},{"term":"aRR","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Background Although Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) diagnostic delays remain a major challenge in health systems, the source of delays has not been recognized in the literature.

Methods Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. Results Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0–2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1–0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15–44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. Conclusions An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","time":1580169600000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated stress among medical students at a university teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Media","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the College of Medicine","category":"Organization"},{"term":"King Saud University","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GAD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Generalized Anxiety Disorder","category":"Organization"},{"term":"students’","category":"Other"},{"term":"Riyadh","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Background and objectives Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students’ perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. Methods We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1–10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. Conclusions Medical students’ psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","time":1580083200000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Cross-sectional prevalence study of MERS-CoV in local and imported dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia, 2016-2018","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.178","urlToImage":""},{"title":"MERS-CoV infection is associated with downregulation of genes encoding Th1 and Th2 cytokines/chemokines and elevated inflammatory innate immune response in the lower respiratory tract","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.179","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Pediatric Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection – UAE","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"Pediatric","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.181","urlToImage":""},{"title":"One Health-based control strategies for MERS-CoV","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.184","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): threats, gaps and containment strategies","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2020.02.025","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Fourth meeting of the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance (EMARIS) network and first scientific conference on acute respiratory infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 11–14 December, 2017, Amman, Jordan","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory","category":"Location"},{"term":"the Eastern Mediterranean Region","category":"Location"},{"term":"the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance","category":"Location"},{"term":"Amman","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Jordan","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Methods We conducted a retrospective study of children ≤2 years old diagnosed with bronchiolitis in a PED over a 7-year period. Rates of PED testing, interventions, and disposition among children whose families’ preferred language was Spanish were compared to children whose families’ preferred language was English. Primary outcomes were frequencies of chest x-ray and bronchodilator orders. Secondary outcomes were diagnostic testing, medication orders, and disposition.

Methods Participants were recruited from the expert pool of the National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development using purposive sampling and snowballing. Participants targeted included government, academics and practicing pharmacists. An interview guide was developed following a literature review and face-to-face, audiotaped interviews conducted with key stakeholders. Results Fourteen semi-structured interviews with both practicing pharmacists and key stakeholder representatives were conducted in China in 2017. Thematic analysis identified 6 main themes which focused on how TCM was integrated with WM in China. Participants agreed that pharmacists should at least assume a role in drug safety associated with concurrent use of TCM and WM. However, barriers were identified within the government, education, pharmacy, pharmacist and research sectors, indicating a lack of coordinated strategies to improve this area of healthcare. A lack of clarity in defining the pharmacists’ role in this area and a disconnect between current regulatory standards and education/training system were the prominent themes. Participants looked towards the government to facilitate actions in the development of policies that support pharmacy practice and practice guidelines, and the review of competency standards, and registration criteria as being the most important enablers.

In recent decades, polysaccharides isolated from different kinds of Chinese herbs have received much attention due to their important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities. Interestingly, different batches of the same herb can obtain different polysaccharide fractions with subtle differences in molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, glycosidic linkages, and biological functions.

They are composed of ∼90 amino acids and form a classical two α-helical/six β-strand structure. The prototypical ligand is the C-terminus of partner proteins; however, they also bind internal peptide sequences. Recent findings indicate that PDZ domains also bind phosphatidylinositides and cholesterol. Through their ligand interactions, PDZ domain proteins are critical for cellular trafficking and the surface retention of various ion channels. In addition, PDZ proteins are essential for neuronal signaling, memory, and learning. PDZ proteins also contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by mediating interactions critical for maintaining cell–cell junctions, cell polarity, and cell migration. Given their important biological roles, it is not surprising that their dysfunction can lead to multiple disease states. As such, PDZ domain–containing proteins have emerged as potential targets for the development of small molecular inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Recent data suggest that the critical binding function of PDZ domains in cell signaling is more than just glue, and their binding function can be regulated by phosphorylation or allosterically by other binding partners. These studies also provide a wealth of structural and biophysical data that are beginning to reveal the physical features that endow this small modular domain with a central role in cell signaling.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.05.013","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chapter Six T Lymphocytes as Measurable Targets of Protection and Vaccination Against Viral Disorders","source":"International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","keywords":[{"term":"Measurable Targets of Protection and Vaccination Against Viral Disorders","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Continuous epidemiological surveillance of existing and emerging viruses and their associated disorders is gaining importance in light of their abilities to cause unpredictable outbreaks as a result of increased travel and vaccination choices by steadily growing and aging populations.

In the meantime, however, metagenomic sequencing efforts are revealing enteric viruses as the most abundant dimension of the intestinal gut ecosystem, and the first gut virome-wide association studies showed that inflammatory bowel disease as well as type 1 diabetes could be linked to the presence or absence of particular viral inhabitants in the intestine. In line with the genetic component of these human diseases, mouse model studies demonstrated how beneficial functions of a resident virus can switch to detrimental inflammatory effects in a genetically predisposed host. Such viral-induced intestinal immune disturbances are also recapitulated by several gastrointestinal infectious viruses such as rotavirus and human norovirus. This wide range of viral effects on intestinal immunity emphasizes the need for understanding the innate immune responses to gastrointestinal viruses. Numerous nucleic acid sensors such as DexD/H helicases and AIM2 serve as cytosolic viral guardians to induce antiviral interferon and/or pro-inflammatory inflammasome responses. In both cases, pioneering examples are emerging in which RNA helicases cooperate with particular Nod-like receptors to trigger these cellular responses to enteric viruses.

These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA sensors. The binding of PAMPs to these receptors triggers the production of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which protect surrounding cells from infection. Some ISGs are nucleic acids-binding proteins that bind viral nucleic acids and suppress their replication. As nucleic acids are essential components that store and transmit genetic information in every species, infectious pathogens have developed systems to escape from the host nucleic acid recognition system. Host cells also have their own nucleic acids that are frequently released to the extracellular milieu or the cytoplasm during cell death or stress responses, which, if able to bind pattern-recognition receptors, would induce autoimmunity and inflammation. Therefore, host cells have acquired mechanisms to protect themselves from contact with their own nucleic acids.

Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host.

They are a major contributing factor of disease in industrialized countries, and are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and a direct annual financial loss of $6-7 billion in North America alone. They are an increasingly challenging health issue due to multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci among others, along with an increasing number of susceptible patients. Over the last three decades, the risk of HCAIs has increased in the radiology department (RD) in part because of an increased number of patients visiting the department and an increase in the utilization of imaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss how patients and staff can be exposed to HCAIs in the RD, including contaminated inanimate surfaces, radiology equipment, and associated medical devices. As the role of medical imaging has extended from primarily diagnosis to include more interventions, the implementation and development of standardized infection minimization protocols and infection control procedures are vital in the RD, particularly in interventional radiology. With globalisation and the rapid movement of people regionally, nationally, and globally, there is greater risk of exposure to contagious diseases such as Ebola, especially if infected patients are undiagnosed when they travel. For effective infection control, advanced training and education of HCWs in the RD is essential. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of HCAIs as related to activities of the RD. We will discuss the following major topics including the variety of HCAIs commonly encountered, the role of the RD in HCAIs, transmission of infections to patients and HCWs in the RD, standard infection prevention measures, and the management of susceptible/infected patients in the RD. We shall also examine the role of, and the preparedness of, HCWs, including RD technologists and interventional radiologists, who may be exposed to undiagnosed, yet infected patients. We shall conclude with a brief discussion of the role of further research related to HCAIs.

Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jpha.2020.02.010","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Importance of Viral Disease in Dairy Cow Fertility","source":"Engineering","keywords":[{"term":"BHV)-1","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Escherichia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"BHV-4","category":"Location"},{"term":"Trueperella","category":"Other"},{"term":"Schmallenberg","category":"Other"},{"term":"SBV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BTV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BTV-8","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Importance of Viral Disease","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Many viral diseases are endemic in cattle populations worldwide. The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.eng.2019.07.020","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Animal Disease Control: Challenges and Perspectives","source":"Engineering","keywords":[{"term":"Animal Disease Control","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.eng.2019.11.011","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Durable Survival Outcomes in Primary and Secondary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Following High-Dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Using a Thiotepa, Busulfan, and Cyclophosphamide Conditioning Regimen","source":"Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia","keywords":[{"term":"HDC/ASCT","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NHL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CNS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HDC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TBC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SCNSL)/CNS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ASCT","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PFS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"High-Dose Chemotherapy","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Using","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Survival Outcomes","category":"Other"},{"term":"Busulfan","category":"Other"},{"term":"Primary","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Thiotepa","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Background High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) has been investigated in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with CNS involvement with promising results.

In this study, the Large Eddy Simulation was utilized to predict the effects of thermal plume of different intensities on particle diffusion. Three postures of the human body model and three room temperatures were considered. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the human body varies greatly with different postures. The coefficient is the largest when the model is in sitting posture, leading to the greatest heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the thermal plume generated by bending the thigh increases the size of the facial thermal plume in horizon direction. The increase of the difference between indoor temperature and skin temperature causes an increase of the convective heat transfer of the manikin, leading to stronger airflow in front of the face. The thicker and faster the human thermal plume is, the more difficult it is penetrated by aerosols produced by nasal breathing, finally resulting in most particles distributed within 0.2 m thick under the roof.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935","urlToImage":""},{"title":"What is ahead for health policy and technology in the 2020s?","source":"Health Policy and Technology","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.003","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Assessing factors critical to smart technology applications to mobile health care − the fgm-fahp approach","source":"Health Policy and Technology","keywords":[],"body":"Abstract Smart technologies present numerous opportunities for enhancing mobile health care.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. Methods Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. Results Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2′2′-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. Conclusions These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","time":1582243200000,"url":"10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Rhinovirus Type in Severe Bronchiolitis and the Development of Asthma","source":"The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice","keywords":[{"term":"RSV)-","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RSV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RV-A","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RV-C","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Development of Asthma","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RV)-induced","category":"Other"},{"term":"Bronchiolitis","category":"Other"},{"term":"Finland","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)- and rhinovirus (RV)-induced bronchiolitis are associated with an increased risk of asthma, but more detailed information is needed on virus types.

Objectives The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of outbreak reports from India during 2008–16, that reported the steps in outbreak investigation. The secondary objectives were to (1) describe the outbreak reports by selected characteristics (source, investigating agency, disease, time, place and person) (2) estimate the proportion of outbreaks that conducted analytical and additional studies. Methods We searched eight electronic databases and grey literature for outbreak investigation reports among humans at community settings from India during 2008–2016. We developed a check-list based on the 10-steps approach used by Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. This checklist was used to independently screen and extract data on general characteristics of the outbreak investigation reports and the steps completed. We adopted The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) check list for prevalence studies to examine the credibility and consistency. The protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017065038). We calculated proportion of reports that followed the steps in their investigation and descriptive statistics on selected characteristics. Results Of 10,657 articles screened, 136 articles were included for the review. Completion of the ten steps in the outbreak investigations was seen in 16% of reports. The highest level of completion was for drawing conclusion in outbreak investigation (98%) and the lowest completion (29%) was for developing a case definition by time, place and person followed by conducting an analytic study (24%). Conclusions Outbreak reports from India either lacked application of systematic steps for investigation or failed to report the actual procedures followed. We recommend improving systematic investigation of outbreaks through training and supervision of outbreak response teams and encouraging publications.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.cegh.2019.02.010","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Retraction—Chinese medical staff request international medical assistance in fighting against COVID-19","source":"The Lancet Global Health","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30076-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Tumour travel tours – Why circulating cancer cells value company","source":"Biomedical Journal","keywords":[{"term":"the Biomedical Journal","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Leptospira","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Tumour","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Welcome to the New Year and a new issue of the Biomedical Journal, where we learn that travelling with company boosts the metastatic potential of circulating tumour cells, as well as that a worm could be an excellent model to study antidiabetic drugs.

The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (ΔCp = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (ΔCp = -5.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of ΔCp from 0 to ∼-2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of ΔCp of ∼-3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ∼20°C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of ΔCp greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ∼20°C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from ΔCp ∼ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts. Large negative values of ΔCp as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37°C. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (ΔSa_immob) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. ΔSa_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. ΔSa_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative ΔSa_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0°C to 40°C in the case of dsDNA viruses. Compared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative ΔSa_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment factors takes much of the entropy loss for ΔSa_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37°C. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making ΔSa_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37°C.","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Le service de soins intensifs (réanimation) adultes à Genève, Suisse","source":"Anesthésie & Réanimation","keywords":[{"term":"Résumé Le","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Faculté de Médecine de l’Université de Genève","category":"Organization"},{"term":"The University Hospitals of Geneva","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Faculty","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the University of Geneva","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Intensive care unit","category":"Organization"},{"term":"de Genève","category":"Other"},{"term":"SAPS2","category":"Other"},{"term":"Genève","category":"Other"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Switzerland","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Résumé Le complexe hospitalier universitaire de Genève est le plus grand de Suisse et est couplé à la Faculté de Médecine de l’Université de Genève.

Methods The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. Results The Student's t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender.

This retrospective study examined the fecal tests records from 1111 dogs and 203 cats with diarrhea submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in the city of Medellin between January and May 2018. The detection of parasites was carried out by direct smears and simple flotation methods. Parasitic organisms were detected in feces from 464 (41.7%) dogs and 96 (47.3%) cats. In order of decreasing prevalence, the parasites detected in dogs were: Giardia intestinalis (13%), ancylostomids (12.6%), Entamoeba spp. (6.1%), coccidian oocysts (5.8%), Toxocara spp. (5.6%) and Dipylidium caninum (1.3%). In cats, the prevalence was: Giardia intestinalis (20%), coccidian oocysts (8.9%), Entamoeba spp. (7.9%), ancylostomids (6.4%), Toxocara spp. (2.5%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%). Age, but not gender, was a predisposing factor, as puppies and kittens had significantly higher infection rates that older age categories. The majority of Giardia intestinalis positive cases occurred in puppies (109/145, 75.2%) and kittens (19/36, 52.8%), making this parasite the most prevalent in amongst animals with diarrhea. Out of 117 positive infections in the adult dog population, ancylostomids accounted for 56 cases (47.9%) and was the most common parasite in this age group. In conclusion, although these results do not imply a cause and effect relationship, they are an estimate of the type of parasites that may be most commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs and cats. The lower diagnostic sensitivity of the traditional methods used here as compared to more contemporary techniques like fecal flotation with centrifugation and PCR, may have underestimated the actual prevalence and diminished the detection of co-infections. Future studies should aim to have diagnostic panels that also screen for other enteric pathogens, including bacterial and viral agents.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100335","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium isolates from diarrheal dairy calves in France","source":"Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","keywords":[{"term":"Cryptosporidium","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PCR-RFLP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IIaA17G1R1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IIdA22G1 (2/27","category":"Organization"},{"term":"France","category":"Nation"},{"term":"IIaA17G3R1","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Cryptosporidium is an obligate intracellular protist parasite infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts and causes significant intestinal disease in both animals and humans, as some species are zoonotic. Cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist. However, little is known about the genetics of Cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of France. The aim of this study was to detect and isolate Cryptosporidium spp. in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves (≤45 days-old) in France. A total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments (French administrative provinces). Cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent (DFA) staining method. DFA-positive samples were then analysed by PCR-RFLP and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to determine species. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested PCR analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene product. Data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis. DFA revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 (88%) samples. Combined with 18S rRNA gene analysis results, C. parvum was detected in 30 samples. Subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples (90%) of the C. parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families, IIa (24/27) and IId (3/27). Four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family IIa, including the hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide (21/27), IIaA17G3R1 (1/27), IIaA17G1R1 (1/27), and IIaA19G1R1 (1/27). Two subtypes were recognised within the IId subtype family including IIdA22G1 (2/27) and IIdA27G1 (1/27). These findings illustrate the high occurrence of Cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised C. parvum isolates with the first description of IIaA17G3R1, IIaA19G1R1, and IId subtypes in France. The presence of zoonotic C. parvum subtype families (IIa, IId) in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic C. parvum, and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk. Further molecular studies in calves and small ruminants from other French regions are required to better understand the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in France.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100323","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Neospora caninum, A potential cause of reproductive failure in dairy cows from Northern Greece","source":"Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","keywords":[{"term":"Neospora","category":"Other"},{"term":"Holstein – Friesian","category":"Other"},{"term":"Northern Greece","category":"Location"},{"term":"Xanthi","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Neospora caninum infection has been reported in a large number of intermediate hosts, such as ruminants, rabbits, mice, etc. but neosporosis has emerged as a serious disease in cattle and dogs worldwide.

According to clinical examination, abdominal imaging and laboratory analyses, a tentative diagnosis of severe glomerulopathy with massive proteinuria was made. Due to worsening of the clinical signs despite therapeutic interventions and a poor prognosis, the cat was euthanised. Necropsy and histological examinations revealed severe bilateral collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy, generalised oedema and a focal verminous pneumonia with thrombosis in arterial lung vessels containing nematode cross sections. A serum sample was tested for the presence of antibodies against the cat lungworm A. abstrusus, resulting negative.

As A. abstrusus and A. vasorum are both gastropod transmitted nematodes, they may share the same intermediate hosts within overlapping areas. In addition, especially chronic A. abstrusus infected cats become non-patent and do not excrete L1. Considering that patent A. vasorum infections are widespread in the dog and fox population in Switzerland (and several other countries) but are apparently not patent in cats, we cannot exclude that infections with A. vasorum may occur more frequently than expected.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100342","urlToImage":""},{"title":"First report on natural infection with Leishmania infantum in a domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) in Spain","source":"Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","keywords":[{"term":"Mustela","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Leishmania","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Spain","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Histoplasma","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract A pet domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) with a papular lesion involving the right pinna was diagnosed with chronic pyogranulomatous dermatitis by histopathologic examination.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20·8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12·1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15·7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/S2468-1253(19)30342-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Antimicrobial resistant and extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli isolated from fecal samples of African dromedary camels","source":"Scientific African","keywords":[{"term":"Escherichia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Kenya","category":"Nation"},{"term":"AMR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MDR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ESBL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"AMR E. coli","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract This study was conducted to determine the distribution of antimicrobial resistance among Escherichia coli isolated from feces of healthy dromedary camels in Kenya.

Hydrothermal Processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be employed to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscaleability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling.

In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells.

Here, we evaluated various novel luciferase immunosorbent assays (LISA) based on nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as fragments derived from spike protein (S) including subunit 1 (S1), N terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD) and subunit 2 (S2) of S for the detection of MERS-CoV-specific IgG. Fusion proteins, including nanoluciferase (NLuc) and various fragments derived from the NP or S protein of MERS-CoV, were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells. LISAs that detected anti-MERS-CoV IgG were further developed using cell lysates expressing various fusion proteins. Panels of human or animal samples infected with MERS-CoV were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of various LISAs in reference to a MERS-CoV RT-PCR, commercial S1-based ELISA, and pseudovirus particle neutralization test (ppNT). Our results showed that the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISAs were more sensitive than the NTD- and S2-LISAs for the detection of anti-MERS-CoV IgG. Furthermore, the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISAs were more sensitive (by at least 16-fold) than the commercially available S1-ELISA. Moreover, the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISA specifically recognized anti-MERS-CoV IgG and did not cross-react with samples derived from other human CoV (OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63)-infected patients.

Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P=0.010). Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P=0.020). The patients with a negative BAL were more likely to be started on steroids (OR 0.19, P= 0.043). Conclusions BAL was helpful to determine the etiology of pulmonary complications and optimize antimicrobials. The addition of AGA and multiplex PCR to standard BAL significantly impacted de-escalating antibiotics and adjusting antifungals to provide adequate coverage. The association with an elevated AGA with antibacterial de-escalation highlights a new role for BAL in antimicrobial optimization.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.infpip.2019.100029","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Urban Governance for a Sustainable Future","source":"One Earth","keywords":[{"term":"Urban Governance","category":"Other"}],"body":"Cities have the potential to lead the way to a cleaner, greener, more inclusive future, but this cannot be achieved without effective leadership and governance.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of Novel Coronavirus Infections Involving 13 Patients Outside Wuhan, China","source":"JAMA","keywords":[{"term":"Epidemiologic","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1001/jama.2020.1623","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Preparation for Possible Sustained Transmission of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: Lessons From Previous Epidemics","source":"JAMA","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1581379200000,"url":"10.1001/jama.2020.1960","urlToImage":""},{"title":"US Emergency Legal Responses to Novel Coronavirus: Balancing Public Health and Civil Liberties","source":"JAMA","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Health and Human Services","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HHS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Civil Liberties","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Alex Azar","category":"Other"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"With increasing numbers of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally and in the United States, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar declared a national public health emergency on January 31.

Given the continual spread of COVID-19 around the world, understanding the action items that were implemented quickly in Taiwan and assessing the effectiveness of these actions in preventing a large-scale epidemic may be instructive for other countries. COVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Chinese and Taiwanese were expected to travel for the holidays. Taiwan quickly mobilized and instituted specific approaches for case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect the public health. Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers’ infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days. Persons with low risk (no travel to level 3 alert areas) were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS (short message service) messaging to their phones for faster immigration clearance; those with higher risk (recent travel to level 3 alert areas) were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phone to ensure that they remained at home during the incubation period. Moreover, Taiwan enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms (based on information from the National Health Insurance [NHI] database) who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19; 1 was found of 113 cases. The toll-free number 1922 served as a hotline for citizens to report suspicious symptoms or cases in themselves or others; as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine. This rapid response included hundreds of action items (eTable in the Supplement).","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1001/jama.2020.3151","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore","source":"JAMA","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Epidemiologic Features","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool.

Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994","urlToImage":""},{"title":"What Does the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mean for Families?","source":"JAMA Pediatrics","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.0828","urlToImage":""},{"title":"What does $8 billion for coronavirus say about opioid funding?","source":"Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Weekly","keywords":[{"term":"Congress","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the State Targeted Response","category":"Organization"},{"term":"The State Opioid Response","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the White House","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Capitol Hill","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Obama","category":"Other"}],"body":"Last week, Congress gave $8 billion to the fight against coronavirus, seemingly overnight.

The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV.

I wish to emphasize and thank the Guest Editors of this special issue, Yvan Saeys and Greg Finak, for their outstanding success and hard work to assemble excellent manuscripts for this issue. I am referring to their guest editorial giving you more details on aims and scopes and elaborating on specific articles. I started drafting this editorial while attending the annual Photonics West conference in San Francisco, presumably the largest showcase on photonics technologies and instrumentation. Scientifically, the sub‐conference BIOS demonstrated the broadness and vividness of photonics technologies in life sciences and particularly in single cell analysis. When searching for relevant literature for this editorial, I was also tracking the actual global developments. This brought me to change my focus and comment on some issues that are relevant to our field and somewhat related to that of the special issue. First of all, Nature Methods announced their Method of the Year 2019 1. It is: “Single‐cell multimodal omics” and acknowledges (among others) the important contribution of highly multiplexed flow cytometry and cell sorting to the increased understanding of single cell biology and cell systems. This is motivating and confirms that cytometry is receiving the focus of attention. Concurrently, in the last weeks the relevance of the recent COVID‐19 (2019‐nCoV) outbreak and its effects started to become evident as everybody was monitoring the number of cases registered globally 2. As conference chairs, we were facing the fact that many of our speakers and colleagues became unavailable. Not only that, but the eeriness of the infection (it is transmissible already during its asymptomatic latency period of up to two weeks, recent results indicate even longer) gave many attendees an uneasy feeling. This brings me to two points worth discussing. (a) Are large scale conferences with global attendance still state of the art or should they be rethought; and (b) to what extent can cytometry support global efforts in various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases? In the past one to two decades the world faced several outbreaks of different viral infections that were luckily not as disastrous as initially anticipated but still claimed victims. These were coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in 2002/2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) with occasional outbreaks since 2012 or influenza viruses like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010. It is only a matter of time until other pandemics follow. Global travel for work and leisure supports viral spread and can transport the infection to nearly all places of the globe within days. Global conferences contribute to such a rapid spread and one should reconsider this model of scientific exchange from time to time and scrutinize potential alternatives. Models for sustainable international conferences are under testing and combine venues in close proximity to institutions with a substantial expertise on the focus area of the conference with virtual participation and contribution by internet for participants on more distant places. Although personal meetings are essential for optimal information exchange, a reduction in travel would not only reduce the risk of dissemination of disease but, as a side effect, could result in budgetary savings, reduce travel‐related emissions (in the wake of Greta), and eliminate jetlag. Now, what can Cytometry do for help in pandemics? Cytometry has already supported several achievements as a quick and non‐representative literature search shows. Image cytometry methods 3 and bead‐based flow cytometry methods 4 are at hand to enable for screening and detecting antibody virus interactions and detect viral antigens. Airway memory T‐cells and viral E protein mutations have been identified in CoV infections a potential targets for vaccine strategies 5, 6. Immune responses seem to be indicative of disease severity 6, 7 but more studies are needed to have a practical assay for decision making at hand. In fact, easy to use and rapid assays derived from Cytomics or multi‐OMICS approaches are needed to rapidly distinguish severe from mild cases and identify future critically ill individuals before symptom onset. Such a test would clearly take the pressure off of the clinicians because only those with high probability to becoming critically ill would receive intensive care early. Hopefully we will see more related studies in this journal in the near future.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1002/cyto.a.23990","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics","source":"Drug Development Research","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Angiotensin","category":"Other"}],"body":"At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1002/ddr.21656","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19: Lessons from SARS and MERS","source":"European Journal of Immunology","keywords":[{"term":"104","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID‐19","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Within weeks of the first cases, a series of papers were released detailing the epidemiology of the disease (now termed COVID‐19) [1-3].

From the first cohort of patients, 8 complete genomes were 99.9% identical in sequence. Given that the typical RNA coronavirus evolves at a rate of 104 nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [4]. SARS‐CoV‐2 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands, surfaces and aerosolised droplets; extensive human‐to‐human transmission is evident, with clusters of infected families and medical staff [5]. The number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly, at a rate that far outstripped the rate of rise of cases of SARS in 2002/3, raising serious global health concerns.

Patients requiring medical care in an intensive care unit inherently burden the system more, both in terms of supplies in personnel, but also because they typically have greater lengths of stay. The volume of healthcare‐associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have been observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Indeed, hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease transmission during these events. In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) outbreak in Toronto highlighted this very real vulnerability, where busy emergency departments, delays in isolation, and improper personal protective equipment (PPE) use fueled the spread of disease in several hospitals.2 Enhanced infection prevention measures were eventually implemented (higher level of PPE, masking when in public areas, among others), which helped bring transmission to halt. After the outbreak was believed to be over, however, directives were given to discontinue those enhanced infection prevention measures. As a result of this and staff no longer routinely wearing masks in general hospital areas, a second phase of the outbreak began. An overwhelming majority of cases in Phase II of the Toronto SARS‐CoV were related to healthcare transmission.3","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.1002/hsr2.149","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Recent advances in the detection of respiratory virus infection in humans","source":"Journal of Medical Virology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"RSV","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health.

Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human adenovirus (hAdV), and human rhinovirus (hRV). Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.

To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals.

A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus 2 closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GeneBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on the 25th November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy and Europe, as well.

Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available.

To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time.

Methods Sera were obtained near onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Results Of 43 HCoV-associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21 to 40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Conclusions Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for serologic detection of HCoV infections. This article is protected by copyright.

The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID-2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3, was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (p-value < 0.05). Position 723 in the COVID-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared to SARS and Bat SARS-like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen.

In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.

We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22?24 November 2019 and 1.19?1.31 ? 10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. This article is protected by copyright.

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).

More rigorous government control policies were associated with slower increase of the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for sars-cov-2 led to the upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive therapeutic strategy.

In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and MERS coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotides analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage (RESU) and effective number of codons (ENc) were analysed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important non-structural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS and SARS CoVs. These genes include Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), Envelop(E) and membrane (M) genes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5-20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs.

SARS-CoV2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic-structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS-CoV2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor non-structural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in SARS-CoV2 (AS-SCoV2). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The AS-SCoV2 located in the acidic-domain of papain-like protein of SARS-CoV2 and bat-SL-RatG13 guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat-SL-CoV-RaTG13. The implication of this amino acid signature in papain-like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in SARS-CoV and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol) and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has a lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one π-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study. This article is protected by copyright.

A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was soon found to be the cause. At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the NCBI and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level, 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although overall variation in ORF regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95) respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes.

Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei. METHODS: A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study. The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases. The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases. History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases. Median time from illness onset to ED admission was 5 days for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases, respectively. Fever was observed in 27 (84%) and 57 (68%) diagnosed and negative cases, respectively. Nineteen (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had lymphopenia on admission in ED. A chest CT scan on admission revealed the presence of pneumonia in the majority of the diagnosed patients (30 out of 32, 94%) and in 56 (67%) negative cases. Bilateral involvement and ground-glass opacity (GGO) were present in 91% and 47% of the diagnosed patients. CONCLUSION: The initial clinical features of patients suspected of having COVID-19 in EDs outside Hubei were relatively mild. Meanwhile, diagnosed patients without definite exposure history tend to show more atypical initial clinical features in ED. No initial clinical feature was found to be specific to diagnosed patients, which could allow for early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in EDs. We recommend strict medical observation and quarantine of all patients suspected of having COVID-19, either in the ED itself or in a dedicated quarantine facility, irrespective of initial clinical features, especially in under-resourced regions without access to rapid nucleic acid amplification tests.

The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. Results Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%).

In 2009, pregnant women accounted for 1% of patients infected with influenza A subtype H1N1 virus, but they accounted for 5% of all H1N1-related deaths6. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two notable strains of the coronavirus family, are both known to be responsible for severe complications during pregnancy, including the need for endotracheal intubation, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), renal failure and death7, 8. Interestingly, the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Chen et al.9 reported the clinical characteristics of nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the third trimester, which comprised mainly fever and cough. Other symptoms included myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Data from laboratory tests showed that the majority of patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein, and chest CT scans showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress in two of nine patients and premature rupture of the membranes in two of nine patients. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Another series10 of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting from mid-trimester onwards, or during the postpartum period, reported similar findings except for one woman requiring ICU care and ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome after the infection was diagnosed 2?days postpartum. In general, both studies reported that the clinical characteristics of the pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia2-4. These observations are also in line with what has been learned about COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy in several other hospitals in Wuhan, China. Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk-assessment and infection-control guidelines following exposure to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Histopathology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogenesis and clarify effective therapies. Use of immunostaining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tropism for cells can be evaluated to correlate with lesions. In the lung, lesions and immunostaining can be qualitatively described to define the cell types, microanatomic location, and type of changes seen. These features are important and necessary, but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups.

Nsp13 is among the evolutionary most conserved proteins not only in CoVs but also in nidovirales. Thus, it is considered as an important drug target. However, the high-resolution structure of CoV nsp13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, which hindered the structure-based drug design.

In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI.

Currently, there are about 1000 patients who need ventilatory support and another 120 new patients daily who require noninvasive or invasive ventilation support in Wuhan city; however, there are only about 600 ICU beds [4].

An equally great (or potentially greater) problem is the shortage of trained personnel to treat these critically ill patients. Until the crisis, there were about 300 ICU physicians and 1000 ICU nurses in Wuhan city.

There are logistical issues which make care of the patients difficult. These include donning of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, respiratory and eye protection), lack of instruments and disposables, and shortages of supplemental oxygen. Many severe hypoxemic patients only receive high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rather than invasive mechanical ventilation because of intubation delay or lack of mechanical ventilators (especially at early phase). Our preliminary data show that only about 25% of patients who died were intubated and received mechanical ventilation.JO - Intensive Care Medicine","time":1583107200000,"url":"10.1007/s00134-020-05979-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical features and short-term outcomes of 18 patients with corona virus disease 2019 in intensive care unit","source":"Intensive Care Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1583107200000,"url":"10.1007/s00134-020-05987-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China","source":"Intensive Care Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x","urlToImage":""},{"title":"How to balance acute myocardial infarction and COVID-19: the protocols from Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital","source":"Intensive Care Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1007/s00134-020-05993-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Findings of lung ultrasonography of novel corona virus pneumonia during the 2019-2020 epidemic","source":"Intensive Care Medicine","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1007/s00134-020-05996-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Imaging features of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia","source":"European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1581638400000,"url":"10.1007/s00259-020-04720-2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"(18)F-FDG PET/CT findings of COVID-19: a series of four highly suspected cases","source":"European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"PURPOSE: The aim of this case series is to illustrate the (18)F-FDG PET/CT findings of patients with acute respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China.

The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The 2019 novel cornoavirus pneumonia with onset of oculomotor nerve palsy: a case study","source":"Journal of Neurology","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GBS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Guillain","category":"Other"}],"body":"On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [1,2,3].

Since PDCoV was first detected in 2009 in Hong Kong, the prevalence of PDCoV has increased in recent years, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. The presence of serum and milk IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. Here, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA) using the purified S1 portion of S protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect PDCoV IgA antibodies in serum and sow's milk. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the PDCoV-S1-IgA-ELISA based on samples confirmed by IFA. Anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay, and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for PDCoV. The indirect ELISA method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk IgA levels against PDCoV in pig herds, rapid detection of PDCoV infection in pigs, and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.","time":1581465600000,"url":"10.1007/s00705-020-04541-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus COVID-19 impacts to dentistry and potential salivary diagnosis","source":"Clinical Oral Investigations","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1007/s00784-020-03248-x","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Public awareness of coronavirus in Al-Jouf region, Saudi Arabia","source":"Journal of Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Al-Jouf","category":"Other"},{"term":"Al-Jouf region","category":"Location"}],"body":"Since 2012 and to date, outbreak/new cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were always reported in Saudi Arabia.

This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests.

This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population.

To construct a risk map of different human organs, here we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems. By interrogating the scRNA-seq data, we not only identified the organs such as lung, heart, oesophagus, kidney, bladder and ileum to be risky, but also can locate the specific cell types such as type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of kidney, ileum and oesophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells, which are vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we finally constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-nCoV infection.

There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality.

This study investigates the transport mechanism and deposition patterns of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) within a typical six bedded general inpatient ward cubicle through numerical simulation. It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient’s bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. The outcome of this study can serve as a source of reference for hospital management to better ventilation design strategies for mitigating the risk of infection.","time":1582329600000,"url":"10.1007/s12273-020-0623-4","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children: experts’ consensus statement","source":"World Journal of Pediatrics","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"National Health Committee","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Diagnosis","category":"Other"}],"body":"Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, China, by January 30, 2020, a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China.

Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV.

In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1007/s40484-020-0199-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Modelling the Economic Impact and Ripple Effects of Disease Outbreaks","source":"Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability","keywords":[],"body":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had alarming effects on human lives and the economies of affected countries.

In this study, the main objectives were to evaluate the in vitro aerodynamic deposition profiles of nebulizer generated aerosols and comparatively investigate the local drug availability and anti-inflammatory efficacy of DAS between intratracheal and intravenous dosing. The in vitro evaluation of aerodynamic characteristics and droplet size distribution showed more than 50% aerosol particles with size being < 5 μm, allowing the aerosols to reach the lower respiratory tract. Following intratracheal administration, the drug underwent pulmonary absorption into the bloodstream, rendering an absolute bioavailability of 47.3%. Compared to the intravenous delivery, the intratracheal administration dramatically increased the drug availability in the lung tissue in rats by more than 80-fold, leading to an improved and prolonged local anti-inflammatory efficacy in a lipopolysaccharide induced lung injury model in mice.

However, little is known worldwide regarding the PM1-associated health effects due to a wide lack of ground-based PM1 measurements from air monitoring stations. Methods We collected daily records of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and station-based measurements of air pollution and weather conditions in Shenzhen, China, 2015–2016. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposures to PM1 and PM2.5. Results PM1 and PM2.5 showed significant adverse effects on respiratory disease hospitalizations, while no evident associations with PM1–2.5 were identified. Admission risks for total respiratory diseases were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.14) and 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10), corresponding to per 10 μg/m3 rise in exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 at lag 0–2 days, respectively. Both PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with increased admission for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but exhibited no effects on asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Largely comparable risk estimates were observed between male and female patients. Groups aged 0–14 years and 45–74 years were significantly affected by PM1- and PM2.5-associated risks. PM-hospitalization associations exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly larger risks in cold season than those in warm season among some subgroups. Conclusions Our study suggested that PM1 rather than PM1–2.5 contributed to PM2.5-induced risks of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and effects of PM1 and PM2.5 mainly occurred in cold season.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.11.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Letter from the Editor: Occupational skin disease among healthcare workers during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic","source":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.012","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Behavioral considerations and impact on personal protective equipment (PPE) use: Early lessons from the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak","source":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","keywords":[{"term":"PPE","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.013","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Skin damage and the risk of infection among healthcare workers managing coronavirus disease-2019","source":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.014","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Positive result of Sars-Cov-2 in sputum from a cured patient with COVID-19","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"ince December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread rapidly in Wuhan, China [1]1.

Researchers have warned that the surge in outbreaks outside China, where the virus emerged and most cases have occurred, means that the coronavirus is becoming unstoppable. The World Health Organization has resisted describing the situation as a pandemic. Director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on 2 March that there was still a chance of containing the virus. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO’s emergencies programme, said that using the word pandemic would mean that efforts to contain and slow the spread of the virus have failed, which has proved untrue in China, Singapore and other regions. But other scientists say the surge in international cases marks a tipping point. “I think the epidemiological conditions for a pandemic are met,” says Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. He and others say that although containment measures seem to have kept outbreaks from escalating outside China for more than a month, such procedures might soon become unfeasible on a broader scale. Those efforts have involved quickly identifying infected people and their close contacts, and isolating them to prevent further transmission. “We’ve got to think more carefully about what measures might be sustainable in terms of reducing transmission without shutting down cities completely and stopping people from moving,” says Ben Cowling, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. The efforts include ‘social distancing’, which reduces the average chances that uninfected people will encounter an infected person.

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","time":1582502400000,"url":"10.1038/s41564-020-0688-y","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system","source":"Nature Reviews Cardiology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells through ACE2 receptors, leading to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related pneumonia, while also causing acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.

Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5'-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA. Our results suggest that duplex RNA is a preferred substrate for the helicase activity of nsP13 than duplex DNA at high ATP concentrations.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1038/s41598-020-61432-1","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Processing of the SARS-CoV pp1a/ab nsp7-10 region","source":"Biochemical Journal","keywords":[{"term":"RTC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Thereby","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mpro","category":"Nation"},{"term":"nsp8","category":"Other"}],"body":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of a respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate.

METHODS We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.

Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1073/pnas.2002616117","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The antiviral compound remdesivir potently inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","source":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","keywords":[{"term":"Remdesivir","category":"Other"},{"term":"nsp8","category":"Other"},{"term":"3'-5","category":"Other"},{"term":"RDV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ATP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.","time":1582502400000,"url":"10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A time delay dynamic system with external source for the local outbreak of 2019-nCoV","source":"Applicable Analysis","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics.

We have been asking questions about how well we are preparing children as tomorrow’s citizens and leaders, and if they will have the dispositions, skills and knowledge to take the planet forward for future generations. To try to answer these questions we considered current events happening in both the editors’ local contexts as well as in global events. For instance, the concerns of drought and bush fires in Australia accompanied politicians arguing over swimming pools and women’s sporting facility funding, and there was another attempted political party leadership takeover. In Singapore, people took different stands on the ban on personal mobility devices on pedestrian pavement. At the global level, news about Brexit and the coming United States elections were prominently featured on headlines. More recently, we were alerted to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis affecting many countries around the world. While there have been discussions of 21st century competencies that our children will need to flourish in a future economy, one in which some of their jobs have not been even invented yet, there is another aspect of future-ready education that we need to address—education in times of crisis. During these times of crises, how information is produced and consumed has immense impact on society and economy, and education has an important part to play in ensuring that people are able to interpret accurately the information they come into contact with. Broadly defined, “crisis education” should examine how education is able to address the knowledge, skills and dispositions required for people in precarious times. Given that the COVID-19 event is recent and its potential impact on longer term global movement of people and resources have yet to be seen, we explore the social aspects of this crisis and highlight the impact of misinformation circulating on social media. A review of past IRGEE papers exploring ‘crisis education’ is used to explore the role of geographical and environmental education in combatting the impact of this misinformation. This year we become aware of the COVID-19 outbreak on 31 December 2019. At least tens of thousands of people have been infected and the death toll in China alone has exceeded that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARs) outbreak (figures are taken from the World Health Organization website as of 10 February 2020). The media reminds us of other past deadly virus outbreaks like SARs and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. Unfortunately, unlike SARS and MERS, the current crisis coincided with the period just prior to and during the Lunar New Year, when traditionally millions of people in China and around the world travel back to their hometowns to celebrate the Lunar New Year. This greatly facilitated the spread of the virus during the initial incubation period. The news media are keeping the world updated on processes and procedures, explaining the need for quarantine periods and the need to keep calm and to be cognizant of the heightened general hygiene requirements. Speculation is beginning on the possibilities of what the worldwide economic and social impact of the COVID-19 will be. Unfortunately, what we are also seeing and hearing is the spread of misinformation—information that is false, but not created with the intention of causing harm (e.g., someone posting an idea containing erroneous information, but not realizing it is erroneous). We are seeing misinformation circulated largely on social media, but also in the conventional and digital news outlets.","time":1583798400000,"url":"10.1080/10382046.2020.1730095","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The Effects of Social Media Use on Preventive Behaviors during Infectious Disease Outbreaks: The Mediating Role of Self-relevant Emotions and Public Risk Perception","source":"Health Communication","keywords":[{"term":"Social Media","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Preventive Behaviors","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Emotions and Public Risk Perception","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Infectious Disease Outbreaks","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1581811200000,"url":"10.1080/10410236.2020.1724639","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effects of misleading media coverage on public health crisis: a case of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","source":"Anatolia","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Beijing","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Stohl","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hasin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Rodriguez-Seijas","category":"Organization"},{"term":"& Eaton","category":"Organization"},{"term":"JAMA Psychiatry","category":"Other"}],"body":"ABSTRACTThe coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China has sparked a global epidemic, which the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern on 31st January 2020 (Beijing time).

Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.

Common types of respirators used in healthcare settings are filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Aims of this study were to examine the current attitudes and practices of HCWs regarding the selection and use of respiratory protection and determine the acceptability of a novel PAPR. Methods In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 HCWs from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants were fit tested with a lightweight tight-fitting half-facepiece PAPR (CleanSpace2™ Power Unit, PAF-0034, by CleanSpace Technology®) using the TSI™ Portacount quantitative fit test method. Results Interview results showed that HCWs had a limited role in the selection and use of facemasks and respirators and had been using the devices provided by the hospital. The majority of subjects had no knowledge of hospital policy for the use of facemasks and respirators, had not been trained on the use of respirators, and had not been fit tested previously. Compliance with the use of facemasks and respirators was perceived as being low and facemasks and respirators were typically used only for short periods of time. All 20 participants were successfully fit tested to the CleanSpace2™ PAPR (overall geometric mean fit factor—6768). According to the exit surveys, CleanSpace2™ PAPRs were easy to don (14/20) and doff (15/20) and comfortable to wear (14/20). Most participants believed that PAPRs provide higher protection, comfort and reusability over N95 FFR and can be used during pandemics and other high-risk situations. Conclusions HCWs should be aware of infection control policies and training should be provided on the correct use of respiratory protective devices. PAPRs can be used in hospital settings to protect HCWs from certain highly infectious and emerging pathogens, however, HCWs require adequate training on storage, use, and cleaning of PAPRs.","time":1583539200000,"url":"10.1093/annweh/wxaa020","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Are Powered Air Purifying Respirators a Solution for Protecting Healthcare Workers from Emerging Aerosol-Transmissible Diseases?","source":"Annals of Work Exposures and Health","keywords":[{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Sepkowitz","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Eisenberg","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Ofner-Agostini","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Center for Infectious Disease Research","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Brosseau and Jones","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CDC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Are Powered Air Purifying Respirators a Solution for Protecting Healthcare Workers","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Fowler","category":"Other"},{"term":"Chen","category":"Other"},{"term":"Rachael Jones","category":"Other"},{"term":"Emerging Aerosol-Transmissible Diseases","category":"Other"}],"body":"For the third time in less than 20 years there is global concern about a novel coronavirus causing significant respiratory morbidity and mortality. The first cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were reported by China to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003; one-third of these were among healthcare workers (WHO, 2003). By the end of the outbreak in 2004, more than half (378; 57%) of the 667 SARS cases treated in Asian and Canadian outbreak hospitals were healthcare workers or medical students (Sepkowitz and Eisenberg, 2005). At the time of and for many years after the SARS outbreak, there was much consternation among the medical and infectious disease communities about the organism's mode(s) of transmission. Aerosols (both fine particles and larger droplets) had to be at least partially responsible for the relative ease with which SARS was transmitted from person to person. As more detailed epi-demiologic data were published, this proved to be the case-risk factors for nosocomial transmission of SARS included exposure during aerosol-generating medical procedures, failure to isolate infectious patients, and the lack or uneven use of personal protective equipment (Scales et al., 2003; Fowler et al., 2004; Ofner-Agostini et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009). In May 2014, when the first cases of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were reported in the USA 2 years after initial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, Dr Rachael Jones and I published a Commentary on the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Practice website (Brosseau and Jones, 2014). We argued that MERS was likely an aerosol-transmissible disease, because it resulted in symptoms similar to SARS (cough, diarrhea, and vomiting) and patients would likely undergo aerosol-generating procedures, such as intub-ation and bronchoscopy. As with SARS, early data suggested aerosol transmission of MERS among hospital patients located at some distance from each other. As with SARS, the MERS coronavirus remains viable as an aerosol and on surfaces for long periods of time at low relative humidity. We argued that healthcare workers should be provided with fit-tested N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), at a minimum, when caring for MERS patients. For exposures to high concentrations of infectious particles, such as from patients experiencing severe symptoms or during aerosol-generating procedures , we recommended that healthcare workers should be wearing powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), which offer a higher degree of protection than FFRs. At the time of our Commentary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was recommending contact, droplet, and airborne precautions for MERS; WHO was recommending only contact and droplet precautions. The WHO guidance for MERS, updated in October 2019, now recommends respirators and well-ventilated negative pressure rooms for aerosol-generating procedures (WHO, 2019). While this is a small step forward, the WHO guidance continues to recommend surgical masks for healthcare workers when caring for hospitalized MERS patients.","time":1583798400000,"url":"10.1093/annweh/wxaa024","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Origin and evolution of the 2019 novel coronavirus","source":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Global Outbreak","category":"Other"}],"body":"As of today, the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV has not been determined.

No single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspect case. In our series of positive cases, samples from one suspect case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts,(3) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may not return positive initially. (4) Our suspect case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan.

The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

Comparisons between the viruses were made.Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.

Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1093/nsr/nwaa036","urlToImage":""},{"title":"In this issue of Occupational Medicine","source":"Occupational Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Koh","category":"Other"},{"term":"Occupational Medicine","category":"Organization"}],"body":"The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan city (Hubei Province of central China), presents significant public health challenges not only in china but across all affected countries worldwide.

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A confirmed asymptomatic carrier of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)","source":"Chinese Medical Journal","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000798","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The explosive epidemic outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the persistent threat of respiratory tract infectious diseases to global health security","source":"Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1097/mcp.0000000000000676","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chest CT Findings in Patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 and its Relationship with Clinical Features","source":"Investigative Radiology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"GGO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PII","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chest CT Findings","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PII","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its relationship with clinical features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01).

And the shock will exacerbate the ongoing slowdown in the US and may result in the eurozone barely expanding for a second quarter running in Q1. ▀ Weaker oil demand in the short term has prompted us to lower our Brent oil price forecast. We have cut our projection for growth in crude demand in 2020 by 0.2m b/d to 0.9 mb/d and now forecast Brent crude will average $62.4pb in 2020, down from about $65pb in our January forecast. ▀ Quarterly global growth is likely to strengthen a little in H2 this year as the disruption fades and firms make up for the lost output earlier in the year and the effect of China's policy response starts to feed through. But for 2020 overall, global growth is now likely to be just 2.3%, 0.2pp weaker than previously assumed as a result of the epidemic.","time":1580515200000,"url":"10.1111/1468-0319.12472","urlToImage":""},{"title":"From the frontlines of COVID-19 – How prepared are we as obstetricians: a commentary","source":"BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","keywords":[{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ? now known as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)1 - as a global health emergency.

Different from SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection, the initial presentations or the chief complain of some patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) were gastrointestinal symptoms. So we call upon all the first-line medical staff to be cautious and pay more attention to those untypical patients especially from the epidemic area. Besides, as the viral nucleic acids could be found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients with COVID-19 infection, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission need to be took into account. Based on the previously and recently studies, we speculate that COVID-19 may have some relationship with the gut microbiota through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thus targeting gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia.

The epidemic is causing terrible anguish to many thousands of families and astounding economic damage in Asia. Whilst yet unconfirmed, several research results now point at the hunting, trade and consumption of pangolins as a likely source of the epidemic. Whether or not pangolins do finally prove to be at the origin of this particular virus, the research highlights that the possibility is very real. This may turn out to be a turning point for pangolin conservation, perhaps for the conservation of a great many other species. In 2015, the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pangolin Specialist Group reported concerns that the profound decline in Asian pangolins would lead to traffickers procuring supplies from Africa. The next five years saw their predictions largely fulfilled. Robust results from a range of research approaches showed first an increase in trade and value of pangolins within the West and central Africa and, more recently, growing international trafficking, with China and Vietnam as major destinations. In 2016, the CITES 17th Conference of Parties moved all African pangolin species onto Appendix 1. Not a single research paper published on pangolins in the past 5 years has suggested anything other than desperate jeopardy for all eight of the world’s species. All available researches point to increasing harvesting, with the rise ultimately driven by trade for profit. The plight of over‐hunted pangolins has become a rallying call for conservation over the past few years. New NGO and government funding initiatives have arisen, dedicated to research for their conservation. The dramatically steep decline of the Asian species has been written about in both Science and Nature, the most widely read scientific journals of the day, in the last few years. The pangolin, alongside the elephant, is a poster species for action against the illegal wildlife trade. However, the research community’s awareness of the impending doom has not in the least stemmed the trade. This issue contains a Short Communication reporting for the first time trade in pangolins in yet another country, South Sudan. I am unsure of what the public response to the possibility that pangolins can transmit deadly viruses will be. I hope it is to leave them alone, rather than to try to eradicate them. This Journal remains committed to improving knowledge of the African ecosystems and increasingly to reporting research that shows how they are changing in the face of our actions. This issue, as each issue, makes a new and relevant contribution to that objective.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1111/aje.12732","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Implications of Emerging Infections for Transplantation","source":"American Journal of Transplantation","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Implications of Emerging Infections for Transplantation","category":"Organization"}],"body":"The recent identification of an outbreak of 2019- novel Coronavirus is currently evolving, and the impact on transplantation is unknown.

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Electronical medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases was not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) were the most common signs of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=0.486, p<0.001) and non-severe (r=0.469, p<0.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe patients (all p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggest eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elder age, high number of comorbidities and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1111/all.14238","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) in pregnancy: What clinical recommendations to follow?","source":"Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica","keywords":[{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CDC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on managing COVID-19, which include some recommendations specific to pregnant women mostly drawn on experience from previous coronavirus outbreaks.8, 9 Chinese expert recommendations for the care of pregnant women with suspected and confirmed COVID-9 were developed and disseminated in China quite early following the outbreak in Wuhan.10 These recommendations have been dynamic, evolving as more knowledge about epidemiology, pathogenesis, disease progression and clinical course among infected pregnant patients has been gathered.

As of 9 February 2020, there now have been at least 813 deaths from a novel strain of coronavirus that is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China (2019-nCoV), at the end of 2019. These deaths are in the context of the 37 558 cases of 2019-nCov which have already been diagnosed in China and multiple other countries.1 In the United Kingdom (UK), recent research by University College London, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, has found that 1 in 20 UK teachers now report long-lasting mental health problems, illustrating a dramatic increase from around 1/100 teachers affected in this way in the 1990s.2 In the United States (US), a recent report by Accenture (Artificial Intelligence [AI]: Healthcare's new nervous system), estimates that AI in health will be worth around $6.6 billion by 2021 and that “…when combined, key clinical health AI applications can potentially create $150 billion in annual savings for the US healthcare economy by 2026.”3 What do these facts and statistics have in common? Taken together they illustrate the massive range and rate of change in health and the responsibility of healthcare globally. In this context a valid question can be asked about the role of general medical journals such as the International Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP). Having taken over as Editor in Chief of IJCP in January this year, I have the honour of leading an internationally renowned medical journal, with a team of extremely accomplished clinician editors, published by Wiley, one of the world's leading biomedical publishers. In our rapidly changing healthcare world, IJCP is eager, committed and ideally suited to undergo a transition process as well. As a team, our view is that in a healthcare environment of seemingly ever-increasing specialisation, one key role that a Journal such as ours should move to fulfil is to publish important, high quality medical research and opinion that will inform specialist clinicians about important general medical concepts, practical insights and recent advances. Similarly, we will also aim to inform generalists about key speciality medical advances that have relevance to generalists in the provision of care to their patients. In this work a foundational aspect of our editorial approach will be rather than looking for reasons to reject submissions, to clearly identify problems with submitted research and opinion if they exist, and work closely with authors to address these issues, allowing those authors to raise the quality of their work to the highest level. In that context, as well as continuing to publish submissions from internationally important clinicians and medical researchers worldwide, we also see that IJCP should aim to specifically encourage less experienced authors who nonetheless have important information to share with the global healthcare community. In this way, IJCP will drive forward its primary function of improving global health through the dissemination of world leading medical information and debate.

There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P > .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). Conclusion The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1111/jebm.12381","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Epidemic: What Are the Risks for Older Patients?","source":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1111/jgs.16407","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19: Emerging compassion, courage and resilience in the face of misinformation and adversity","source":"Journal of Clinical Nursing","keywords":[{"term":"Alison Kitson","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract In her excellent editorial, ?Rising from the ashes: affirming the spirit of courage, community resilience, compassion and caring?

In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species.","time":1581984000000,"url":"10.1111/jzo.12769","urlToImage":""},{"title":"2019_nCoV/SARS-CoV-2: rapid classification of betacoronaviruses and identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine as potential origin of zoonotic coronaviruses","source":"Letters in Applied Microbiology","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Sarbecovirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SIGNIFICANCE","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The current outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, 2019_nCoV(now named SARS-CoV-2), illustrated difficulties in identifying a novel coronavirus and its natural host, as the coding sequences of various Betacoronavirus species can be highly diverse. By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.","time":1582848000000,"url":"10.1111/lam.13285","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Liver injury during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections","source":"Liver International","keywords":[{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global public health.

This study is aimed to score the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia using both the original GFT and mGFT. The publicly available data on human cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Saudi Arabia (2012-2018) were sourced from the FluTrackers, World Health Organization, Saudi Ministry of Health, and published literature associated with MERS outbreaks investigations. The risk assessment of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia was analyzed using the original GFT and mGFT criteria, algorithms, and thresholds.

In this study, we conducted a large-scale surveillance of CoVs in chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and other birds (quails, sparrows and partridges) using a conserved RT-PCR assay.

The problem began in 2018 when unusually heavy rains on the Arabian Peninsula allowed populations to boom over several generations. In October 2019, the locusts swarmed south into Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, and in late December, they spread to Kenya, causing the worst infestation there in 70 years. Somalia—which last week declared a national emergency and asked for increased food aid—has already lost 100,000 hectares of crops and pasture. Another generation of locusts will likely hatch this month and cause more damage. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations called for $70 million to fight the outbreak with pesticides and help farmers. ### Glaciology After dropping sensors and a torpedo-shaped robot through a 700-meter hole in the ice, scientists in Antarctica last week revealed the first direct evidence that warm ocean temperatures around the rapidly retreating Thwaites Glacier could destabilize the key ice sheet. Researchers are worried because Thwaites—larger than the state of Illinois—helps block the ocean from reaching and warming the even bigger, unstable West Antarctic Ice Sheet, whose melting could eventually drive meters of sea level rise. Battling 2 months of stormy conditions, the team measured ocean waters beneath Thwaites at more than 2°C above the freezing point. The robot, Icefin (above, shown operating elsewhere in Antarctica), provided the first images of the glacier's grounding zone, the mysterious boundary where the floating coastal ice sheet attaches to bedrock. The project is part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a multiyear effort by the United States and the United Kingdom that is wrapping up its first full field season. ### Leadership Some researchers in Colombia are calling for a little-known molecular biologist appointed as the country's first ever science minister to resign. They are outraged by reports that she treated cancer patients with a fungal extract, without running a formal clinical trial. “We can only regret that the course of how to do science in our country has been left in the hands of pseudoscience,” the Colombian Association of Medical Faculties wrote in a statement. In December 2019, Mabel Gisela Torres Torres was appointed to lead the newly created Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. In January, she told a newspaper she did not seek formal ethical, safety, and efficacy reviews of her work with patients because she believed the fungus posed no threat to human health. Her Ph.D. adviser has defended her and notes that metabolites in the fungi Torres studied have shown potential as a cancer treatment in cell and mouse studies. ### Environmental science ![Figure][2] CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) J. BRAINARD/ SCIENCE ; (DATA) UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FOR WATER, ENVIRONMENT, AND HEALTH The world's growing flows of wastewater offer a largely untapped, potentially lucrative source of energy, agricultural fertilizers, and water for irrigation, a comprehensive study says. The opportunities will increase as the annual volume of wastewater—now 380 billion cubic meters—expands by an estimated 51% by 2050, as populations and incomes multiply, says a team led by researchers at United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment, and Health. About 13% of global demand for fertilizer could be met by recovering nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash from wastewater; such use provides a bonus, diverting nutrients from waterways, where they can create harmful eutrophication. Sewage also offers an alternative energy source. The need to plan and finance such recovery efforts is greatest in “low- and middle-income countries, where most municipal wastewater still goes into the environment untreated,” says the study, published 27 January in Natural Resources Forum. ### Conservation A decision by South Africa's government to allow breeding and genetic research on more than 30 wild species—including rhinos, lions, and cheetahs—could considerably reduce their genetic diversity, scientists warned last week. The government's action has been interpreted to allow breeders to select for commercially desirable traits, such as longer horns or larger body size; that could create genetic bottlenecks by promoting a few stud lines, the researchers wrote in the South African Journal of Science. They added that it may prove expensive or impossible to keep the intensively bred animals from mating with wild counterparts. A handful of game ranchers requested the policy, which South Africa announced in May 2019 without consulting the public or studying potential consequences. Game ranching —for hunting, meat, and tourism—already occupies more than 15% of the country, and the government wants to expand the industry. ### Funding The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) announced this week seven winners in its contest for “big ideas” to address societal problems. Four winning teams will receive $26,000 each to develop ideas on topics ranging from using artificial intelligence for complex problem-solving to developing small-scale technologies that sequester carbon dioxide. Three more teams earned $10,000 as runners-up. The 2026 Idea Machine contest attracted almost 800 submissions, and although some high schoolers made it to the semifinals, all the winners work at research institutions. NSF hopes to fund workshops and exploratory grants to further develop these and other ideas from contestants. ### Publishing A software company said last week it has teamed up with publishing giant Wiley to roll out in mid-2020 a tool that can signal whether findings in Wiley's scientific papers are reproducible. The software, called [Scite.ai][3], uses artificial intelligence to examine articles that cite a paper, and determines and displays whether they provide evidence supporting or contradicting the paper's findings. Users can browse and search the relevant text of the citing articles. Scite CEO Josh Nicholson says the software allows users to home in on articles that attempted to reproduce a study; of every 100 citations analyzed, Scite has found that 94 merely note the paper cited. The addition of Wiley's articles will expand Scite's current trove of more than 14 million papers from other publishers, most in the biomedical sciences. Nicholson expects his company to sign agreements with additional publishers to analyze their articles. ### Biomedicine The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) said this week it will award $13.5 million to 30 patient advocacy groups to support their work finding treatments for rare diseases. Of an estimated 7000 rare diseases, fewer than 5% have treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Each group will receive $450,000 over 2 years as well as training and mentoring as part of the foundation's Rare As One Project, launched last year to help advocates develop networks of patients, clinicians, and scientists. Most of the diseases are autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and other inherited disorders, but the list of diseases also includes rare cancers. CZI, founded by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan, his wife, has made a few other awards to rare disease groups. The initiative expected to make just 10 Rare As One awards but tripled the number after receiving 275 applications. ### Conservation The Trump administration proposed last week to end penalties on owners of open oil storage ponds and other industrial operations that kill birds accidentally. The administration will instead encourage voluntary efforts to protect birds. Conservation groups cried foul, saying the change to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 will only embolden companies to take actions that threaten vulnerable species. ### BRAIN Initiative gets leader Since its launch in 2013, the U.S. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative has doled out about $1.3 billion to develop tools that map and manipulate the brain. Until now, the multiagency effort has had no formal director. But last week, neurobiologist John Ngai of the University of California, Berkeley, was named to take the helm in March. (A longer version of the interview is at <https://scim.ag/BRAINdirector>.) > Q: Why is BRAIN getting a director? > A:The initiative has been run day to day by a terrific team of senior program directors and staff with oversight from the 10 [U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)] institutes and centers that are involved in BRAIN. I think as enterprises emerge from their startup phase, the question is how do you translate this into a sustainable enterprise, and yet maintain this cutting-edge innovation? … The initiative really will benefit from somebody thinking about this 24/7. > Q: What distinguishes this second phase of BRAIN? > A:In the first phase, there was a very intentional and concentrated focus on tool development.

I am hopeful that BRAIN, with other efforts in NIH and in partnership with industry, [can create] technology platforms that could be applied across multiple disease applications.

To avoid domestic spread of the virus, Japanese officials screened every passenger for disease symptoms and tested them for the virus after they landed. Eight tested positive, but four of those had no symptoms at all, says epidemiologist Hiroshi Nishiura of Hokkaido University, Sapporo—which is a bright red flag for epidemiologists who are trying to figure out what the fast-moving epidemic has in store for humanity. If many infections go unnoticed, as the Japanese finding suggests, that vastly complicates efforts to contain the outbreak. Two months after 2019-nCoV emerged—and with well over 20,000 cases and 427 deaths as Science went to press—mathematical modelers have been racing to predict where the virus will move next, how big a toll it might ultimately take, and whether isolating patients and limiting travel will slow it. But to make confident predictions, they need to know much more about how easily the virus spreads, how sick it makes people, and whether infected people with no symptoms can still infect others. Some of that information is coming out of China. But amid the all-out battle to control the virus, and with diagnostic capabilities in short supply, Chinese researchers cannot answer all the questions. Countries with just a handful of cases, such as Japan, can also reveal important data, says Preben Aavitsland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. “It's up to all countries now that receive cases to collect as much information as possible.” With the limited information so far, scientists are sketching out possible paths that the virus might take, weighing the likelihoods of each, and trying to determine the fallout. “We're at this stage where defined scenarios and the evidence for and against them are really important because it allows people to plan better,” says Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. These scenarios break into two broad categories: The world gets the virus under control—or it doesn't. The most optimistic scenario is one in which 2019-nCoV remains mostly confined to China, where 99% of the confirmed cases have occurred so far. (By 4 February, two dozen other countries had together reported 195 cases.) “There has obviously been a huge amount of spread within China, but [elsewhere], there's no evidence of any kind of substantial human-to-human transmission,” says Robin Thompson, a mathematical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford. “The risk probably isn't as high as some models have been projecting.” If no other countries see sustained transmission and the quarantines and other measures taken in China start to reduce the number of infections there, the risk of spread might gradually go down, and the virus might eventually be quashed. This happened with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which ended after fewer than 9000 cases. That's what the World Health Organization (WHO), which last week declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, hopes for this time. In a press conference, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a global version of the approach his team took in the current Ebola outbreak: Fight the disease at the source and try to keep it from gaining a foothold elsewhere. “Focus on the epicenter,” Tedros said. “If you have several epicenters, it is chaos.” Epidemiologist Marion Koopmans of Erasmus Medical Center says it may not be that hard to contain the virus in a new locale as long as the first cases are detected and isolated early—provided the virus is not highly transmissible. “We don't see it taking off in the 200 or so cases seeded outside of China,” Koopmans says. If that pattern holds, “there still is the possibility it will bend off.” She and others suspect the climate may help. Influenza typically only spreads during the winter months and hits northern and southern China at different times. If that is true for 2019-nCoV, its spread might start to slow down in the Northern Hemisphere within a few months. “That is a big question mark we're trying to assess at the moment,” says Joseph Wu, a modeler at the University of Hong Kong. But is containment realistic? Success will depend in part on whether infected people who don't have symptoms can spread the virus. Asymptomatic people are hard to find and isolate, so if they can spread disease, 2019-nCoV “will be very difficult to stop in China,” says Alessandro Vespignani, a modeler of infectious diseases at Northeastern University. But if asymptomatic transmission is rare, he says, “isolation and social distancing can have a big impact.” So far it has been difficult to get a handle on this question. Some data from China seem to support asymptomatic transmission, but none are clear-cut. A widely reported 30 January letter in The New England Journal of Medicine described the case of a Chinese businesswoman who touched off a cluster of four cases in Germany before she became sick herself. But 4 days later, it became clear the researchers had not contacted the woman, who had flown back to China, before the paper was published. In a later phone interview, she said she had experienced some symptoms while in Germany. In follow-up results announced in a 4 February press release, the researchers noted that some patients they studied shed virus even though their symptoms were mild. That's almost as bad as asymptomatic transmission, says virologist Christian Drosten of the Charité University Hospital in Berlin: Patients with mild symptoms are unlikely to seek medical care and may not even stay home, giving the virus ample opportunities to spread far and wide. Based on what they have seen so far, many researchers think it's probably too late to contain the virus. “As the virus continues to spread in China, the risk of exportation to other countries grows and sooner or later we will see it spread in another country,” Aavitsland says. So far there has been no sustained transmission outside of China, but Lipsitch expects that to change: “I would be really shocked if in 2 or 3 weeks there wasn't ongoing transmission with hundreds of cases in several countries on several continents.” If the virus does spread to all corners of the world in a pandemic, several questions will loom large: What percentage of the population will become infected, and of those, how many will get very sick or die? More severe cases place heavier demands on health care systems—hospitals in Wuhan are already overwhelmed—and result in greater fears and disruption of daily life. A deadly pandemic might force the world to make stark choices about fair access to medicines or vaccines, if they become available. It might also lead to widespread restrictions on domestic travel akin to those already in force in China, Aavitsland says. If, on the other hand, 2019-nCoV resembles the common cold or a mild flu, the spread of the virus would be less alarming. Existing travel bans likely would be lifted. Understanding the severity and case fatality rate is a challenge with any new pathogen. When a new influenza strain emerged in 2009—and went on to cause a pandemic—many worried it might turn out to be a nasty variety. It took months to establish that the new virus killed only about one in 10,000 patients. So far, mortality among known 2019-nCoV cases is about 2%, and some reports say 20% of infected people suffer severe disease. But these figures may overlook tens of thousands of people with mild disease—say, a sore throat or a low-grade fever—who never seek medical care and may not even know they were infected with 2019-nCoV. Many may have no symptoms at all. “So what looks like a horrific disease may be the horrific tip of a very large iceberg,” Lipsitch says. The fact that four Japanese evacuees were asymptomatic is a case in point. Studies in China have also reported some cases with few or no symptoms. What's missing is a large study in China, Lipsitch says. He suggests some fraction of the tests that are available in a place with many cases should be set aside for that purpose. (Current recommendations in China call for testing people with clear symptoms only.) If indeed 2019-nCoV becomes pandemic, humanity may be stuck with it indefinitely. After spreading far and wide, the virus might become endemic in the human population, just like four other coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and occasionally cause fresh outbreaks. How much death and disease it would cause is anyone's guess. The silver lining of the epidemic is that scientists have collected and shared information at record speed. “Every day that goes by we know more and every day that goes by we can do better modeling,” Vespignani says. “Unfortunately, this beast is moving very fast.”","time":1580947200000,"url":"10.1126/science.367.6478.610","urlToImage":""},{"title":"News at a glance","source":"Science","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Li Wenliang","category":"Other"}],"body":"Just weeks after a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, the outbreak continued to expand in gravity and scope.

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for eﬀective risk communication.","time":1583020800000,"url":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033026","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Houston we have a problem: coronavirus!","source":"European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy","keywords":[{"term":"Houston","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582243200000,"url":"10.1136/ejhpharm-2020-002240","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Diarrhoea may be underestimated: a missing link in 2019 novel coronavirus","source":"Gut","keywords":[{"term":"Diarrhoea","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1136/gutjnl-2020-320832","urlToImage":""},{"title":"RCVS may relax guidance due to Covid-19","source":"Veterinary Record","keywords":[{"term":"RCVS","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1136/vr.m1009","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19: An Update on the Epidemiological, Clinical, Preventive and Therapeutic Evidence and Guidelines of Integrative Chinese-Western Medicine for the Management of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease","source":"The American Journal of Chinese Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Preventive","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Therapeutic Evidence","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Western Medicine","category":"Organization"}],"body":"As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been documented globally with over 2360 deaths.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1148/radiol.2020200642","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Helping the Radiologist: The Role of Scientific Journals to Help Prevent the Spread of COVID-19","source":"Radiology","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1148/radiol.2020200661","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Patients with RT-PCR Confirmed COVID-19 and Normal Chest CT","source":"Radiology","keywords":[{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Normal Chest CT","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1148/radiol.2020200702","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Performance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT","source":"Radiology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hunan Providence","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Providence","category":"Nation"},{"term":"n=424","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Farsi","category":"Nation"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Respiratory Pathogen Panel","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Rhode Island Hospital","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background Despite its high sensitivity in diagnosing COVID-19 in a screening population, chest CT appearances of COVID 19 pneumonia are thought to be non-specific. Purpose To assess the performance of United States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. Methods A total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.S. radiologists in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively.

Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1008392","urlToImage":""},{"title":"What can early Canadian experience screening for COVID-19 teach us about how to prepare for a pandemic?","source":"Canadian Medical Association Journal","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1503/cmaj.200305","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Prominent changes in blood coagulation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection","source":"Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (CCLM)","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"D-dimer","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Thrombin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Renmin Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FDP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FIB","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Antithrombin","category":"Other"}],"body":"Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused an outbreak in China. Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1515/cclm-2020-0188","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Laboratory abnormalities in children with novel coronavirus disease 2019","source":"Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (CCLM)","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1515/cclm-2020-0272","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Potential preanalytical and analytical vulnerabilities in the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","source":"Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (CCLM)","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1515/cclm-2020-0285","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak: Think the unthinkable and be prepared to face the challenge","source":"Diagnosis","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1580169600000,"url":"10.1515/dx-2020-0015","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Update: Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak - United States, February 24, 2020","source":"MMWR.

The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results.

The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.2214/ajr.20.22975","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Relation Between Chest CT Findings and Clinical Conditions of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Multicenter Study","source":"American Journal of Roentgenology","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hunan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"GGO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"}],"body":"OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes.

This systematic review of current literature on COVID-19 provides insight into the initial and follow-up CT characteristics of the disease.","time":1584144000000,"url":"10.2214/AJR.20.23034","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Nuevo coronavirus 2019-ncov: impacto en salud global","source":"Ciencia y Salud","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"al 2 de febrero","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Se trata de una revisión sistemática de una selección de artículos publicados en diferentes fuentes de información, post aparición del primer caso de 2019-nCoV en China, que incluye la infor-mación disponible a febrero 2 del año 2020 sobre diferentes aspectos clínico-epidemiológicos de la epidemia.

Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.","time":1577836800000,"url":"10.24920/003724","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Potential inhibitors against papain-like protease of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from FDA approved drugs","source":"chemrxiv.org","keywords":[{"term":"Rimanshee","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Vishal","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mukesh","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FDA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ChemRxiv","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PLpro","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MiB)","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Das","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Amit","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Prashar","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Kumar","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"S3/S4","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Licence: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 Citation information: Arya, Rimanshee; Das, Amit; Prashar, Vishal; Kumar, Mukesh (2020): Potential inhibitors against papain-like protease of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from FDA approved drugs.

To better understand the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, we performed computational alanine scanning mutagenesis on the “hotspot” residues at protein-protein interfaces using relative free energy calculations. Our data suggest that the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 lead to a greater binding affinity relative to SARS-CoV.

To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the development of specific antiviral therapeutics to conquer SARS-CoV-2. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 687 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of pharmacokinetically relevant molecular descriptors to narrow down the initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of off-target binding, we report a list of 11 drug-like compounds with improved binding free energy to the target protease in contrast to the cocrystallized peptidomimetic lead compound that suffers from poor pharmacokinetic properties.

The molecular docking results indicate that, the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity for all the studied inhibitors than its SARS homologue. Two docking complexes (indinavir and darunavir) with high docking scores were futher subjected to MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations to detail the molecular interactions between these two proteinase inhibitors and the 3CLpro. Our results show that darunavir has the best binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 3CLpro among all inhibitors, indicating it has the potential to become an anti-COVID-19 clinical drug. The likely reason behind the increased binding affinity of HIV-1 protease inhibitors toward SARS-CoV2 3CLpro than that of SARS-CoV were investigated by MD simulations.

Unfortunately, we still have no pharmaceutical weapons against the diseases caused by these viruses. The pandemic of 2019-nCoV reminds us of the urgency to search new drugs with totally different mechanism that may target the weaknesses specific to coronaviruses. Herein, we disclose a new targeted oxidation strategy (TOS II) leveraging non-covalent interactions potentially to oxidize and inhibit the activities of cytosolic thiol proteins via thiol/thiolate oxidation to disulfide (TOD). Quantum mechanical calculations show encouraging results supporting the feasibility to selectively oxidize thiol of targeted proteins via TOS II even in relatively reducing cytosolic microenvironments. Molecular docking against the two thiol proteases Mpro and PLpro of 2019-nCoV provide evidence to support a TOS II mechanism for two experimentally identified anti-2019-nCoV disulfide oxidants: disulfiram and PX-12. Remarkably, disulfiram is an anti-alcoholism drug approved by FDA 70 years ago, thus it can be immediately used in phase III clinical trial for anti-2019-nCoV treatment. Finally, a preliminary list of promising TOS II drug candidates targeting the two thiol proteases of 2019-nCoV are proposed upon virtual screening of 32143 disulfides.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.26434/CHEMRXIV.11936292.V1","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: Preparedness and readiness of countries in the eastern mediterranean region","source":"Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1580515200000,"url":"10.26719/2020.26.2.136","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama, Japan, 2020","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Diamond","category":"Other"},{"term":"Yokohama","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Post-discharge surveillance and positive virus detection in two medical staff recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), China, January to February 2020","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000191","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Retrospective analysis of the possibility of predicting the COVID-19 outbreak from Internet searches and social media data, China, 2020","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000199","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Updated rapid risk assessment from ECDC on the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"ECDC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the EU/EEA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2003121","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Influenza-associated pneumonia as reference to assess seriousness of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Information on severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (transmissibility, disease seriousness, impact) is crucial for preparation of healthcare sectors.

Therefore, it was necessary to rapidly implement adequately quick and sensitive diagnostic assays for outbreak management of SARS-CoV-2 in public health laboratories. As soon as the World Health Organization (WHO) published the first protocols for real-time RT-PCR assays, the Bavarian Food and Health Authority started to implement them. We ordered control material and oligonucleotides (see details below) in week 4 and ran our first SARS-CoV-2 assays on 27 January (week 5). On the same day, the first German case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed in Bavaria [1]. In the following days, health authorities implemented comprehensive measures to prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including testing of contact persons. We initially used the protocol based on the E gene and RdRp gene developed by the German Consiliary Laboratory for Coronaviruses hosted at the Charité in Berlin [5]. Real-time RT-PCR was initially performed with the QuantiTect Virus +Rox Vial kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Feldkirchen, Germany). The kit was chosen for its frequent and successful use in our laboratory with other assays and its immediate availability. Primers and probes were used as described [5] and provided by TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Control material was ordered from the European Virus Archive (EVAg) and consisted of synthetic Wuhan coronavirus 2019 E gene control (reference number 026N-03866) and SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA (reference number 004N-02005) [6]. In addition, the control of LightMix Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene (TibMolbiol, Berlin, Germany) was used for the SARS-CoV-2 specific assay. Respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum) were obtained from patients and contact persons. Sputum samples were diluted in 2 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS). RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Bio Robot kit (QIAGEN) on a Hamilton Microlab Star (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). As at 1 March, 87,024 cases and 2,979 associated deaths have been reported worldwide [1]. The vast majority of the deaths (96%) have been reported in China [1]. Despite the high number of cases reported globally, estimates of the severity pyramid of disease and case fatality rate remain very uncertain; one large study conducted in China estimated that the majority (81%) of the cases were mild (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia), 14% were severe (e.g. with dyspnoea) and 5% were in a critical condition (i.e. respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2]. The case fatality ratio was 2.3% [2]. Despite extraordinary containment measures implemented in China, including the enforced lockdown of several cities and closures of schools, the virus has spread throughout the country and internationally [2]. It is too early to predict with any certainty the epidemiological developments over the coming weeks, but the possibility of widespread community transmission becoming established throughout the EU/EEA is becoming increasingly likely.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000173","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"the European Union","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the European Economic Area","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely.

The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as &beta;-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC50 = 0.64 &mu;g/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC50 values against virus yield were 1.52 &mu;M and 2.60 &mu;M for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin (IC50 = 0.06 &mu;M) and indigodole B (IC50 = 2.09 &mu;M) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well. This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of S. cusia leaf methanol extract that acted against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner.

We found that the distribution of Wuhan&rsquo;s migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan&rsquo;s migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan&rsquo;s total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20&ndash;24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.3390/ijerph17051729","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in Epidemic Outbreaks: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in Wuhan (China)","source":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Reverse Logistics Network Design","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Effective Management of Medical Waste in Epidemic Outbreaks","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"The outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution.","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.3390/ijerph17051770","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A Meta-Analysis of Multiple Whole Blood Gene Expression Data Unveils a Diagnostic Host-Response Transcript Signature for Respiratory Syncytial Virus","source":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","keywords":[{"term":"RSV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Functional","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide.

Functional enrichment analysis showed several pathways significantly altered, including immunologic response mediated by RSV infection, pattern recognition receptors, cell cycle, and olfactory signaling.

We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.

However, they also face the problems of alumni&rsquo;s economic development difficulties, the risk of deadly infection to medical rescue teams and health workers, infection of teachers and students, and the unsatisfactory application of information technology in resolving the crisis. In response to these risks and emergency problems, we propose some corresponding solutions for public dissemination, including issues related to medical security, emergency research, professional assistance, positive communication, and hierarchical information-based teaching.","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.3390/jrfm13020036","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Prevention Is Better Than the Cure: Risk Management of COVID-19","source":"Journal of Risk and Financial Management","keywords":[{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Global Health Security","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GHS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Antarctica","category":"Location"}],"body":"A novel coronavirus was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in China on 31 December 2019.

Possible difficulties that the policy faces include: the weakness of the online teaching infrastructure, the inexperience of teachers (including unequal learning outcomes caused by teachers&rsquo; varied experience), the information gap, the complex environment at home, and so forth. To tackle the problems, we suggest that the government needs to further promote the construction of the educational information superhighway, consider equipping teachers and students with standardized home-based teaching/learning equipment, conduct online teacher training, include the development of massive online education in the national strategic plan, and support academic research into online education, especially education to help students with online learning difficulties.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.3390/JRFM13030055","urlToImage":""},{"title":"2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics","source":"Micromachines","keywords":[{"term":"PoC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Road for Rapid Detection","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"We believe a point-of-care (PoC) device for the rapid detection of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial and urgently needed.

Contamination of foods by bacterial pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella typhimurium) results in human infection. A typical example is the current issue with Coronavirus, which has the potential for foodborne transmission and ruling out such concerns is often difficult. Although, the possible dissemination of such viruses via the food chain has been raised. Standard bacterial detection methods require several hours or even days to obtain the results, and the delay may result in food poisoning to eventuate. Conventional biochemical and microbiological tests are expensive, complex, time-consuming and not always reliable. Therefore, there are urgent demands to develop simple, cheap, quick, sensitive, specific and reliable tests for the detection of these pathogens in foods. Recent advances in smart materials, nanomaterials and biomolecular modeling have been a quantum leap in the development of biosensors in overcoming the limitations of a conventional standard laboratory assay. This research aimed to critically review bacteriophage-based biosensors, used for the detection of foodborne pathogens, as well as their trends, outcomes and challenges are discussed. The future perspective in the use of simple and cheap biosensors is in the development of lab-on-chips, and its availability in every household to test the quality of their food.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.3390/nano10030501","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Host Factors Affecting Generation of Immunity Against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Pregnant and Lactating Swine and Passive Protection of Neonates","source":"Pathogens","keywords":[{"term":"IgA (sIgA","category":"Location"},{"term":"IgA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Generation of Immunity","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Passive Protection","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Host Factors","category":"Other"},{"term":"Lactating Swine","category":"Other"}],"body":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly virulent re-emerging enteric coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea, dehydration, and up to 100% mortality in neonatal suckling piglets. Despite this, a safe and effective PEDV vaccine against highly virulent strains is unavailable, making PEDV prevention and control challenging. Lactogenic immunity induced via the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, remains the most promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce protective maternal IgA antibodies that passively transfer into colostrum and milk. Identifying variables that influence lymphocyte migration and IgA secretion during gestation and lactation is imperative for designing maternal immunization strategies that generate the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV in suckling piglets. Because pregnancy-associated immune alterations influence viral pathogenesis and adaptive immune responses in many different species, a better understanding of host immune responses to PEDV in pregnant swine may translate into improved maternal immunization strategies against enteric pathogens for multiple species. In this review, we discuss the role of host factors during pregnancy on antiviral immunity and their implications for generating protective lactogenic immunity in suckling neonates.","time":1581984000000,"url":"10.3390/pathogens9020130","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Insights into the Recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Light of Past Human Coronavirus Outbreaks","source":"Pathogens","keywords":[{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002.

In this sense, the objective of the present article was to review studies on the role of wild animals as reservoirs and/or dispersers of etiological agents of human infectious diseases in order to compile data on the main wild animals and etiological agents involved in zoonotic outbreaks. A systematic review was carried out using PRISMA guidelines, using the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO platforms as data banks. The descriptors used were “zoonosis”, “human infectious diseases” and “wild animals”. The results show that wild animals (mainly bats, birds and primates) play an important role in the dissemination of etiological agents (mainly viruses, as a new coronavirus called 2019 Novel Coronavirus) in extensive geographic regions. Moreover, these wild animal organisms can act as the site for essential biotic synergy among several pathogenic microorganisms, promoting a higher rate of adaptation, mutation and even genetic recombination, with consequent stimulation of new strains and subtypes, inducing new infectious agents with unknown virulent potential. In conclusion, the monitoring of these diseases and adequate preparation for possible epidemics and pandemics are fundamental conditions for the mitigation of their future impact. The zoonotic threat of these etiological agents and the impact on public health can be enormous as shown by the ongoing epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) infections.","time":1577836800000,"url":"10.4103/1995-7645.277535","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) update: What we know and what is unknown","source":"Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"disease[6","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Preliminary clinical features indicated that most of the infected patients were men with underlying diseases (comorbidities) including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease[6].

METHODS: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed patients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction number(R), and the effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 4.2655, while the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.5555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early, but the peak of the epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased.

The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.4414/smw.2020.20224","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","source":"BioScience Trends","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.5582/bst.2020.01020","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia receiving combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment","source":"BioScience Trends","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.5582/bst.2020.01030","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Challenges to the system of reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies: reflections on the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in China","source":"BioScience Trends","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at a critical period in the control of the epidemic.

Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.5582/bst.2020.01043","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Breakthrough: Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies","source":"BioScience Trends","keywords":[{"term":"Chloroquine","category":"Other"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.5582/bst.2020.01047","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19: Real-time dissemination of scientific information to fight a public health emergency of international concern","source":"BioScience Trends","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients, and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible effectiveness of various interventions.

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.5607/en20009","urlToImage":""},{"title":"An outbreak of <scp>COVID</scp> ‐19 caused by a new coronavirus: what we know so far","source":"Medical Journal of Australia","keywords":[{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID‐19","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HKU1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Australia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Iran","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"‐19","category":"Nation"}],"body":"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China in December 2019. The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002–2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of “superspreading” events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in Australia, across five jurisdictions. Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non‐Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insig​htplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coron​avirus-no-place-for-racism-xenop​hobia/).","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.5694/mja2.50530","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19 and the Risk to Health Care Workers: A Case Report","source":"Annals of Internal Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"the Risk to Health Care Workers","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.7326/L20-0175","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Reporting, Epidemic Growth, and Reproduction Numbers for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Epidemic","source":"Annals of Internal Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"Reproduction Numbers","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1580860800000,"url":"10.7326/M20-0358","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application","source":"Annals of Internal Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MEASUREMENTS","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"National Institute of Allergy","category":"Organization"},{"term":"National Institute of General Medical Sciences","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Confirmed Cases","category":"Other"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. LIMITATION: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. CONCLUSION: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.","time":1577836800000,"url":"10.9781/ijimai.2020.02.002","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era","source":"JAMA Pediatr","keywords":[{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Transmissibility","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MAIN OUTCOMES","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Postelimination Era","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Factors Associated","category":"Other"},{"term":"Measles Transmission","category":"Other"}],"body":"IMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings.

A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles).

However, little is known of the role of IL-11 during viral infections. In this study, IL-11 expression at mRNA and protein levels were found to be high in Vero cells and the jejunum of piglets during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, while IL-11 expression was found to be positively correlated with the level of viral infection. Pretreatment with recombinant porcine IL-11 (pIL-11) was found to suppress PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells, while IL-11 knockdown promoted viral infection. Furthermore, pIL-11 was found to inhibit viral infection by preventing PEDV-mediated apoptosis of cells by activating the IL-11/STAT3 signaling pathway. Conversely, application of a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor significantly antagonized the anti-apoptosis function of pIL-11 and counteracted its inhibition of PEDV. Our data suggest that IL-11 is a newfound PEDV-inducible cytokine, and its production enhances the anti-apoptosis ability of epithelial cells against PEDV infection. The potential of IL-11 to be used as a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets deserves more attention and study.","time":1576908000000,"url":"10.1186/s13567-019-0729-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Association between Hospital Nurses’ Perception of Patient Safety Management and Standard Precaution Adherence: A Cross-Sectional Study","source":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"participants’","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Patient Safety Management","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Standard Precaution Adherence","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Cross-Sectional Study","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Standard precautions should be applied to prevent health care-associated infections during every nursing activity.

The percentages of confirmed cases identified out of the total numbers of travelers that passed through entry screening measures in various countries worldwide for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) and EVD in West Africa were zero or extremely low. Entry screening measures for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) did not detect any confirmed SARS cases in Australia, Canada, and Singapore. Despite the ineffectiveness of entry and exit screening measures, authors reported several important concomitant positive effects that their impact is difficult to assess, including discouraging travel of ill persons, raising awareness, and educating the traveling public and maintaining operation of flights from/to the affected areas.

The objective of this study was to identify and define a set of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) indicators to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies. METHODS: A three-round modified Delphi technique was employed to develop indicators for PHEP. The study was conducted in Canada with a national panel of 33 experts and completed in 2018. A list of indicators was derived from the literature. Indicators were rated by importance and actionability until achieving consensus. RESULTS: The scoping review resulted in 62 indicators being included for rating by the panel. Panel feedback provided refinements to indicators and suggestions for new indicators. In total, 76 indicators were proposed for rating across all three rounds; of these, 67 were considered to be important and actionable PHEP indicators. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed an indicator set of 67 PHEP indicators, aligned with a PHEP framework for resilience. The 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice in Canada that can be used by local/regional public health agencies and validated in other jurisdictions to assess readiness and measure improvement in their critical role of protecting community health.","time":1577080800000,"url":"10.1371/journal.pone.0226489","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The burden and clinical manifestation of hospitalized influenza among different pediatric age‐groups in the tropics","source":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","keywords":[{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"B.

However, ≥10 years old had the highest other complications, ICU/ high‐dependency admissions and influenza B Victoria rates. CONCLUSIONS: Infants <6 months had the highest hospitalization rates for influenza. The 6‐month to <5‐year‐age‐group had the highest complication rate especially neurologic. Influenza A patients were younger, had higher seizure rates and complications compared to influenza B.","time":1578895200000,"url":"10.1111/irv.12692","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Inhibition effects of patchouli alcohol against influenza a virus through targeting cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways","source":"Virol J","keywords":[{"term":"Herba","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Akt","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ERK","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MAPK","category":"Organization"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a tricyclic sesquiterpene extracted from Pogostemonis Herba, which is a traditional Chinese medicine used for therapy of inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have shown that PA has various pharmacological activities, including anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects. METHODS: In this study, the anti-influenza virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of PA against IAV in vitro were evaluated by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay. The neuraminidase inhibition assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and western blot assay were used to explore the anti-viral mechanisms. The anti-IAV activities in vivo were determined by mice pneumonia model and HE staining. RESULTS: The results showed that PA significantly inhibited different IAV strains multiplication in vitro, and may block IAV infection through inactivating virus particles directly and interfering with some early stages after virus adsorption. Cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA. Intranasal administration of PA markedly improved mice survival and attenuated pneumonia symptoms in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, Patchouli alcohol has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-IAV agent in the future.","time":1577080800000,"url":"10.1186/s12985-019-1266-x","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Impaired production of immune mediators in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of adults with end stage renal disease","source":"Sci Rep","keywords":[{"term":"IL-2","category":"Other"},{"term":"IL-1Ra","category":"Other"},{"term":"IL-8","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GM-CSF","category":"Organization"},{"term":"protein-1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"VEGF","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TNF)-α","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ESRD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IL-12p40","category":"Nation"},{"term":"TNF-α","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MIP-1b","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Chronic kidney disease is an epidemiologically identified risk factor for development of severe dengue in dengue-affected patients.

The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT: In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. Then the sequence similarity is used as the final similarity of receptors according to the prediction results. The 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) are used to assess the prediction performance of our method. We also compare our method with other three competing methods (BRWH, LapRLS, CMF). CONLUSION: The experiment results show that IILLS achieves the AUC values of 0.8675 and 0.9061 with the 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), respectively, which illustrates that IILLS is superior to the competing methods.

As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. RESULTS: In this study we highlighted the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (≈19 kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ≈2 kb long) gene. We have quantified changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compared these to theoretical expectations.

To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012–2018 were tested. RESULTS: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26–17.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Lao’s public. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012–2018.

Early stage diagnosis of the associated diseases or inflammation onset is almost impossible by conventional analytical manners. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates a simple, rapid, and cost-effective label-free chemiluminescence bioassay based on magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) for sensitive detection of haptoglobin by employing the specific interaction of hemoglobin-modified MNPs. The resulting haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex inhibits the peroxidase-like activity of luminol/H(2)O(2)-hemoglobin-MNPs sensing scheme and reduces the chemiluminescence intensities correspondingly to the innate haptoglobin concentrations. Quantitative detection of bovine haptoglobin was obtained within the range of 1 pg mL(−1) to 1 µg mL(−1), while presenting 0.89 pg mL(−1) limit of detection.

In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend across species, we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species (P. pygmaeus and P.kuhlii).

AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM.

Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.","time":1578895200000,"url":"10.1186/s12913-019-4884-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Illumination of PRRSV Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Epitopes by the Three-Dimensional Structure and Peptidome of Swine Lymphocyte Antigen Class I (SLA-I)","source":"Front Immunol","keywords":[{"term":"CTL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PRRSV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SPF","category":"Organization"},{"term":"pSLA-1(*)1502","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pro","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PRRSV CTL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SLA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Three-Dimensional Structure and Peptidome of","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Swine Lymphocyte Antigen","category":"Organization"},{"term":"pSLA-1(*)1502","category":"Location"},{"term":"SLA-1(*)1502","category":"Nation"},{"term":"pSLA-1(*)1502","category":"Nation"},{"term":"NSP9-TMP9","category":"Nation"},{"term":"IFN-γ","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Lymphocyte Epitopes","category":"Other"}],"body":"To investigate CTL epitope applications in swine, SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains were explored by crystallography, biochemistry, and the specific pathogen-free (SPF) swine experiments. First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-γ expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.","time":1578463200000,"url":"10.3389/fimmu.2019.02995","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Note from the editors: Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow","source":"Euro Surveill","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1578549600000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.1.2001091","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Infection Prevention Measures for Surgical Procedures during a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South Korea","source":"Sci Rep","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"the Arabian Peninsula","category":"Location"},{"term":"Healthcare","category":"Organization"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"}],"body":"In 2015, we experienced the largest in-hospital Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula.

The more recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health. New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired. In this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZIKV cDNA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZIKV in vivo. A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice. Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice. The rZIKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice. Interestingly, infectious rZIKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZIKV cDNA in the absence of transfection reagent. Further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDNA clone encoding an attenuated rZIKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZIKV challenge. This novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems. Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future.","time":1579154400000,"url":"10.1038/s41598-020-57545-2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Strategies to Target Specific Components of the Ubiquitin Conjugation/Deconjugation Machinery","source":"Front Chem","keywords":[{"term":"Target Specific Components","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Ubiquitin Conjugation/Deconjugation Machinery","category":"Organization"}],"body":"The regulation of ubiquitination status in the cell is controlled by ubiquitin ligases acting in tandem with deubiquitinating enzymes.

We further manipulated the infectious clone by replacing the NS6 gene with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP; likewise, rPDCoV-ΔNS7 was constructed by removing the ATG start codons of the NS7 gene. Growth kinetics studies suggest that rPDCoV-ΔNS7 could replicate similarly to that of the wild-type PDCoV, whereas rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP exhibited a substantial reduction of viral titer in vitro and in vivo. Piglets inoculated with rPDCoV-ΔNS7 or wild-type PDCoV showed similar diarrheic scores and pathological injury.

Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10–25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1–2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016–2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples.

Apart from bacterial infections, paramyxo-, adeno-, reo- and arenaviruses cause these diseases. In 2014, new viruses emerged as the cause of pneumonia in pythons. In a few publications, nidoviruses have been reported in association with pneumonia in ball pythons and a tiger python. The viruses were found using new sequencing methods from the organ tissue of dead animals. METHODS: Severe pneumonia and stomatitis resulted in a high mortality rate in a captive breeding collection of green tree pythons. Unbiased deep sequencing lead to the detection of nidoviral sequences. A developed RT-qPCR was used to confirm the metagenome results and to determine the importance of this virus. A total of 1554 different boid snakes, including animals suffering from respiratory diseases as well as healthy controls, were screened for nidoviruses. Furthermore, in addition to two full-length sequences, partial sequences were generated from different snake species. RESULTS: The assembled full-length snake nidovirus genomes share only an overall genome sequence identity of less than 66.9% to other published snake nidoviruses and new partial sequences vary between 99.89 and 79.4%. Highest viral loads were detected in lung samples. The snake nidovirus was not only present in diseased animals, but also in snakes showing no typical clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further highlight the possible importance of snake nidoviruses in respiratory diseases and proof multiple circulating strains with varying disease potential. Nidovirus detection in clinical healthy individuals might represent testing during the incubation period or reconvalescence. Our investigations show new aspects of nidovirus infections in pythons.

Lethal complications involving the inflamed tonsils include haemorrhage, retropharyngeal abscess and disseminated sepsis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics. There were no signs of upper or lower airway obstruction. She was found to be unresponsive by her caregiver and gasping for air in her bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of treatment. Autopsy showed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema. Histological examination of the palatine tonsils revealed prominent lymphoid hyperplasia, but no evidence of acute inflammation. CONCLUSION: Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy in infants is a common feature of both viral and bacterial tonsillitis and has been postulated as a possible risk factor for Sudden and Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI), based on the theory of mechanical impediment of breathing by narrowing of the upper airway. The rounded shape of the tonsils may facilitate some airflow past the enlarged structures and hence protect against asphyxial death when the enlarged tonsils fill the laryngo-pharynx. Epiglottal and proximal laryngeal edema may play a more significant role in asphyxial unexpected deaths in cases of tonsillitis with tonsillar hypertrophy than previously suspected. This focusses the importance of careful examination of the epiglottis and proximal laryngeal mucosa, as part of a thorough examination of the laryngo-pharynx in cases of sudden death associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.","time":1579500000000,"url":"10.1186/s12887-020-1927-3","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus targets Paneth cells to inhibit the self-renewal and differentiation of Lgr5 intestinal stem cells via Notch signaling","source":"Cell Death Dis","keywords":[{"term":"TGEV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Notch","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Paneth","category":"Nation"},{"term":"APN","category":"Other"}],"body":"Infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been associated with villous atrophy within 48 h, which seriously disrupts intestinal homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","time":1579500000000,"url":"10.1038/s41419-020-2233-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Endoplasmic reticulum: a focal point of Zika virus infection","source":"J Biomed Sci","keywords":[{"term":"ZIKV","category":"Other"},{"term":"Flavivirus","category":"Other"},{"term":"ZIKV-affected","category":"Other"},{"term":"Flaviviridae","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SPCS1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"EMC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Zika","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family.

In this study, we examined the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Bactrian and hybrid camels in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (where dromedaries are also present), and Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China (where dromedaries are absent). For the 29 serum samples from Bactrian camels in Dubai tested by the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and neutralization antibody test, 14 (48%) and 12 (41%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies.

This observation supported the importance of non-coding RNAs and it was confirmed in several organisms. The most abundant non-translated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding RNAs, they show a more cell-specific expression. To understand the function of lncRNAs, it is fundamental to investigate in which cells they are preferentially expressed and to detect their subcellular localization. Recent improvements of techniques that localize single RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions. In recent years, single-cell transcription variability was associated with non-coding RNA expression, revealing this class of RNAs as important transcripts in the cell lineage specification.

This review discusses the distribution of lignans in nature according to their structural classification, and it provides a comprehensive summary of their antiviral activities. Among them, two types of antiviral lignans—podophyllotoxin and bicyclol, which are used to treat venereal warts and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in clinical, serve as examples of using lignans for antivirals—are discussed in some detail.

This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.","time":1579586400000,"url":"10.3389/fnbot.2019.00113","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Characterization of Influenza A Virus Infection in Mouse Pulmonary Stem/Progenitor Cells","source":"Front Microbiol","keywords":[{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"IL)-6","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IFN)-γ","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mouse","category":"Organization"},{"term":"mPSCs","category":"Nation"},{"term":"mPSCs","category":"Other"}],"body":"The pulmonary stem/progenitor cells, which could be differentiated into downstream cells to repair tissue damage caused by influenza A virus, have also been shown to be the target cells of influenza virus infection.

First, mPSCs and its immortalized cell line mPSCs(Oct4+) were shown to be susceptible to PR8, seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and H7N9 influenza viruses and can generate infectious virus particles, although with a lower virus titer, which could be attributed by the reduced vRNA replication and nucleoprotein (NP) aggregation in the cytoplasm.

Furthermore, ISG15 exerts functions in its free form both, as an intracellular and as a secreted protein. In agreement with its role as a type I IFN effector, most functions of ISG15 and ISGylation are linked to the anti-pathogenic response. However, also key roles in other cellular processes such as protein translation, cytoskeleton dynamics, exosome secretion, autophagy or genome stability and cancer were described. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) constitutes the major ISG15 specific protease which counteracts ISG15 conjugation. Remarkably, USP18 also functions as a critical negative regulator of the IFN response irrespective of its enzymatic activity. Concordantly, lack of USP18 function causes fatal interferonopathies in humans and mice. The negative regulatory function of USP18 in IFN signaling is regulated by various protein–protein interactions and its stability is controlled via proteasomal degradation. The broad repertoire of physiological functions and regulation of ISG15 and USP18 offers a variety of potential intervention strategies which might be of therapeutic use. Due to the high mutation rates of pathogens which are often species specific and constantly give rise to a variety of immune evasion mechanisms, immune effector systems are under constant evolutionarily pressure. Therefore, it is not surprising that considerable differences in ISG15 with respect to function and sequence exist even among closely related species. Hence, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate the translational potential of results obtained in model organisms especially for therapeutic strategies. This review covers existing and conceptual assay systems to target and identify modulators of ISG15, ISGylation, USP18 function, and protein–protein interactions within this context. Strategies comprise mouse models for translational perspectives, cell-based and biochemical assays as well as chemical probes.","time":1579586400000,"url":"10.3389/fchem.2019.00923","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Note from the editors: novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","source":"Euro Surveill","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1579759200000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2001231","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Infection Up-Regulates FcRn Expression via Nucleocapsid Protein and Secretion of TGF-β in Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells","source":"Front Microbiol","keywords":[{"term":"TGEV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FcRn","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IPEC-J2","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IL-8","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TGF-β","category":"Organization"},{"term":"JNK","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Nucleocapsid Protein","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Secretion of TGF-β","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NF-κB","category":"Location"},{"term":"RIG","category":"Nation"},{"term":"TNF-α","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine intestinal coronavirus that causes fatal severe watery diarrhea in piglets.

TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-κB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.

TGF-β-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-κB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128–252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis.

Poverty alleviation has moved strongly forward in China and the major health indicators are now better than the average of all middle- and high-income countries. However, the dual burden of infectious and chronic diseases remains a challenge with respect to achieving the health target in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development goals (SDGs). In 2015, about 44% of the poor population in China were impoverished by illness but already in 2018, multi-sectoral actions delivered by the Health-related Poverty Alleviation programme had reduced the number almost by half. In the past three years 15 million poor people (98% of the poor population) with infectious and chronic diseases had been treated and taken care of thanks to financial support through multiple health insurance schemes and other governmental subsidies. This article discusses the lessons learnt with regard to health-related poverty alleviation in China with special reference to those still remaining impoverished by illness. Consolidation of the achievements reached and provision of basic needs to those still disadvantaged and in poor health will require a major improvement of accessibility to, and affordability of, health services. The next step towards enhanced productivity and better living conditions will involve upgrading of the capacity of health professionals in the poor regions, promotion of coherent efforts in health-related poverty alleviation and rural revitalization measures. As an additional measure, data monitoring and research on health poverty alleviation should be strengthened as they are essential to generate the evidence and knowledge needed to support the move in the direction envisioned by the SDGs, and the new Healthy China 2030 programme.","time":1580364000000,"url":"10.1186/s40249-020-0626-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Reassessing therapeutic antibodies for neglected and tropical diseases","source":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","keywords":[{"term":"mAbs","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Review","category":"Organization"}],"body":"In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them. IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible.","time":1580277600000,"url":"10.1128/mSphere.00807-19","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Regulation of the ER Stress Response by the Ion Channel Activity of the Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Envelope Protein Modulates Virion Release, Apoptosis, Viral Fitness, and Pathogenesis","source":"Front Microbiol","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"EIC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TMD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"rIBVs","category":"Organization"},{"term":"rA26F/","category":"Organization"},{"term":"F14N","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IBV-","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Viral Fitness","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pathogenesis","category":"Organization"},{"term":"rIBVs","category":"Other"},{"term":"rT16A","category":"Other"},{"term":"A26V","category":"Other"},{"term":"Apoptosis","category":"Other"}],"body":"Coronavirus (CoV) envelope (E) protein is a small structural protein critical for virion morphogenesis and release.

Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations – rT16A and rA26F – were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations – rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N – were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture.

For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes. In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection.

In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain.

We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5–13) and 11 months (IQR: 6–18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls. CONCLUSION: Viral etiology of pneumonia in SAM children were mainly attributable to RSV, influenza, HPIV and HMPV. Our study findings may help in planning further studies targeting vaccines or drugs against common respiratory viruses responsible for pneumonia among SAM children.","time":1580796000000,"url":"10.1371/journal.pone.0228329","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Detection methods for influenza A H1N1 virus with special reference to biosensors: a review","source":"Biosci Rep","keywords":[{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Orthomyxoviridae","category":"Other"},{"term":"α-2,6","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Antigen–Antibody","category":"Organization"}],"body":"H1N1 (Swine flu) is caused by influenza A virus, which is a member of Orthomyxoviridae family. Transmission of H1N1 occurs from human to human through air or sometimes from pigs to humans. The influenza virus has different RNA segments, which can reassert to make new virus strain with the possibility to create an outbreak in unimmunized people. Gene reassortment is a process through which new strains are emerging in pigs, as it has specific receptors for both human influenza and avian influenza viruses. H1N1 binds specifically with an α-2,6 glycosidic bond, which is present in human respiratory tract cells as well as in pigs. Considering the fact of fast multiplication of viruses inside the living cells, rapid detection methods need an hour. Currently, WHO recommended methods for the detection of swine flu include real-time PCR in specific testing centres that take 3–4 h. More recently, a number of methods such as Antigen–Antibody or RT-LAMP and DNA biosensors have also been developed that are rapid and more sensitive.

In addition, we determined whether EVD-related stigma is a predictor of informal health care use among EVD survivors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 358 EVD survivors in five districts across all four geographic regions (Western Area, Northern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province) of Sierra Leone. Ebola-related stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma (0.71 ± 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale.

As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFNβ, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response.

Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias.

We first characterized the kinetics of PEDV entry into cells and found that the highest invasion rate of PEDV was approximately 33% in the IPEC-J2 cells and approximately 100% in the Vero cells. To clarify the specific endocytic pathways, systematic research methods were used and showed that PEDV enters cells via the clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways, in which dynamin II, clathrin heavy chain, Eps15, cholesterol, and caveolin-1 were indispensably involved. In addition, lipid raft extraction assay showed that PEDV can also enter cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the trafficking of internalized PEDV, we found that PEDV entry into cells relied on low pH and internalized virions reached lysosomes through the early endosome–late endosome–lysosome pathway.

The proportion of Proteobacteria was higher in infected than in healthy piglets, and the opposite was observed for Bacteroidetes (more than four-fold higher in the healthy group). In the infected group, Fusobacterium accounted for 36.56% and 21.61% in the colonic mucosa and contents, respectively, while in the healthy group, they comprised 22.53% and 12.67%, respectively. The percentage of Lactobacillus in healthy colons (15.63%) was considerably higher than that in the disease group (<10%). In both the colonic mucosa and contents, functional enrichment differed significantly between healthy and diseased groups. Overall, infection with the PED virus increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the colons of piglets. Targeting intestinal microbiota could be a promising method for PED prevention, thus opening new avenues for future research.","time":1577685600000,"url":"10.3390/genes11010044","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia due to respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae requiring hospitalization in South Korea","source":"BMC Infect Dis","keywords":[{"term":"CAP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MRMP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RSV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Mycoplasma","category":"Other"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: Community–acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading worldwide causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0–18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children < 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2–18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.","time":1581487200000,"url":"10.1186/s12879-020-4810-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Both ADP-Ribosyl-Binding and Hydrolase Activities of the Alphavirus nsP3 Macrodomain Affect Neurovirulence in Mice","source":"mBio","keywords":[{"term":"Macrodomain","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Y114A","category":"Nation"},{"term":"ADP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SINV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"G32S","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Alphavirus","category":"Organization"},{"term":"G32A","category":"Other"},{"term":"Y114A","category":"Other"}],"body":"Macrodomain (MD), a highly conserved protein fold present in a subset of plus-strand RNA viruses, binds to and hydrolyzes ADP-ribose (ADPr) from ADP-ribosylated proteins. ADPr-binding by the alphavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) MD is necessary for the initiation of virus replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates replication complex amplification. To determine the importance of these activities for pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis, mutations were introduced into the nsP3 MD of Sindbis virus (SINV), and the effects on ADPr binding and hydrolase activities, virus replication, immune responses, and disease were assessed. Elimination of ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities (G32E) severely impaired in vitro replication of SINV in neural cells and in vivo replication in the central nervous systems of 2-week-old mice with reversion to wild type (WT) (G) or selection of a less compromising change (S) during replication. SINVs with decreased binding and hydrolase activities (G32S and G32A) or with hydrolase deficiency combined with better ADPr-binding (Y114A) were less virulent than WT virus. Compared to the WT, the G32S virus replicated less well in both the brain and spinal cord, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease with full recovery of survivors, whereas the Y114A virus replicated well, induced higher expression of interferon-stimulated and NF-κB-induced genes, and was cleared more slowly from the spinal cord with persistent paralysis in survivors. Therefore, MD function was important for neural cell replication both in vitro and in vivo and determined the outcome from alphavirus encephalomyelitis in mice.","time":1581400800000,"url":"10.1128/mBio.03253-19","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: a 15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study","source":"Bone Res","keywords":[{"term":"15-year","category":"Other"},{"term":"FEV(1)/FVC%","category":"Nation"},{"term":"20.23)%","category":"Nation"},{"term":"± 20.59)%","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pulmonary","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis.

The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses.

More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR−/−) mice after vaccination with the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines.

The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic.

Several coronaviruses have been reported to evolve diverse strategies to evade host IFN response. However, whether feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) antagonizes the type I IFN signaling remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FIPV strain DF2 infection not only failed to induce interferon-β (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) production, but also inhibited Sendai virus (SEV) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced IFN-β production. Subsequently, we found that one of the non-structural proteins encoded by the FIPV genome, nsp5, interrupted type I IFN signaling in a protease-dependent manner by cleaving the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO) at three sites—glutamine132 (Q132), Q205, and Q231. Further investigation revealed that the cleavage products of NEMO lost the ability to activate the IFN-β promoter. Mechanistically, the nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the recruitment of the TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) to NEMO, which reduced the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the inhibition of type I IFN production.

We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 µg. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model. This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens.","time":1579500000000,"url":"10.3390/v12010125","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Human Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory Viruses: Underestimated Opportunistic Pathogens of the Central Nervous System?","source":"Viruses","keywords":[{"term":"CNS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Central Nervous System","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract, mostly causing mild diseases. However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.g., pneumonia). Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes. Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases. Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified. Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, with and without acute lower respiratory infection (respectively WRI and WORI groups). METHODS: We studied 44 mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples (collected with a double catheter, Combicath® kit) from patients with mean age in the seventh decade, 20 from WORI group and 24 from WRI group, who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure in Intensive Care Units of two hospitals in the Lisbon area. Real-time PCR was applied to verify analyse the presence of 15 common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, human bocavirus, influenza virus A and B, repiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human enterovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229E, NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in six of the 20 patients in the WORI group: influenza AH3 (n = 2), parainfluenza virus 1/3 (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) and human metapneumovirus (n = 1).

Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. METHOD: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. RESULTS: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of which, some genes, namely BCL6, DLL1, GATA3, IL6, LEF1, LFNG and WNT1 were among the genes with obviously intersected in multiple GO terms. CONCLUSION: The miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes suggested their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV or other related viruses.","time":1581487200000,"url":"10.7717/peerj.8522","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Novel Insights Into Immune Systems of Bats","source":"Front Immunol","keywords":[{"term":"Marburg","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Novel Insights Into Immune Systems of Bats","category":"Organization"}],"body":"In recent years, viruses similar to those that cause serious disease in humans and other mammals have been detected in apparently healthy bats.

SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6–30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10(6) copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area.

The structure reveals that the 5′-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)).

This analysis is part of the World Health Organization Global Observatory on Health Research and Development’s work with the overall aim to enable evidence-informed deliberations and decisions on new investments in health research and development. The analysis expands on the interactive data visualisations of these data on the Observatory’s website and describes the methods used to enable the categorisation of grants by health categories using automated data-mining techniques. METHODS: Grants data were extracted from the World RePORT platform for 2016, the most recent year with data from all funders. A data-mining algorithm was developed in Java to categorise grants by health category. The analysis explored the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaborations between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with. RESULTS: Out of a total of 69,420 grants in 2016, the United States of America’s National Institutes of Health funded the greatest number of grants (52,928; 76%) and had the longest average grant duration (6 years and 10 months). Grants for research constituted 70.4% (48,879) of all types of grants, followed by grants for training (13,008; 18.7%) and meetings (2907; 4.2%). Of grant recipients by income group, low-income countries received only 0.2% (165) of all grants. Almost three-quarters of all grants were for non-communicable diseases (72%; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20%; 11,123), and injuries (6%; 3056).

This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.","time":1581055200000,"url":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1008269","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Complete Genome Sequences of Five Human Coronavirus NL63 Strains Causing Respiratory Illness in Hospitalized Children in China","source":"Microbiol Resour Announc","keywords":[{"term":"HCoV","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hospitalized","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Guangdong","category":"Location"}],"body":"We report the complete genome sequences of five human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) strains obtained using next-generation sequencing.

When combined with X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM provides a routine approach for structurally characterizing the immune complexes formed between icosahedral viruses and their antibodies. In this review, recent advances in the structural understanding of virus-antibody interactions are outlined for whole virions with icosahedral T = pseudo 3 (picornaviruses) and T = 3 (flaviviruses) architectures, focusing on the dynamic nature of viral shells in different functional states. Glycoprotein complexes from pleomorphic enveloped viruses are also discussed as immune complex antigens. Improving our understanding of viral epitope structures using virus-based platforms would provide a fundamental road map for future vaccine development.","time":1578463200000,"url":"10.1007/s12250-019-00190-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Severe Pulmonary Infection in a 20-Month-Old Female","source":"Case Rep Infect Dis","keywords":[{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"VATS","category":"Nation"},{"term":"CAP","category":"Other"},{"term":"CAP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Intensive care unit","category":"Organization"},{"term":"VATS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pulmonary Infection","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is a common reason for hospitalization of a pediatric patient.

Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). There are many subtypes of IAV but only a few seem to be able to adapt to humans and to cause disease. In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory‐confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation. METHODS: 293T, VERO, and MDCK cells were used to conduct Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and pseudoparticle and live virus infections, and to evaluate H7N9 HA cleavage‐activation. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We show that human matriptase/ST 14 is able to cleave H7N9 HA. Cleavage of H7N9 HA expressed in cell culture results in fusogenic HA and syncytia formation. In infection studies with viral pseudoparticles carrying matriptase/ST 14‐activated H7N9 HA, we observed a high infectivity of cells.

We examined the test results and their influence on clinical decisions. Furthermore, as a control group, we retrospectively obtained the clinical data of 70 UP patients between October 2014 and March 2016 (before the FA‐RP was available). The two patient groups were compared with respect to factors, including general antimicrobial use and defined daily dose (DDD) numbers.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co‐infection in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses. METHODS: A total of 341 clinical specimens were collected from patients with influenza or influenza‐like illness and analyzed by ResPlex II assay to detect 18 respiratory viruses. The patterns of co‐infection were statistically analyzed with Fisher's exact test. The samples with double or triple infections were passaged in suspension MDCK cells (MDCK‐S), adherent MDCK cells (MDCK‐A), and LLC‐MK2D cells.

METHODS: Cameroon’s Ministry of Health, in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cameroon Pasteur Center, and National Public Health Laboratory, implemented event‐based surveillance (EBS) in nine Yaoundé health facilities. Four signals were defined that could indicate possible public health events, and a reporting, triage, and verification system was established among partner organizations. A pre‐defined laboratory algorithm was defined, and a series of workshops trained health facilities, laboratory, and public health staff for surveillance implementation.

Nutritional status was calculated by z-scores according to weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma leptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy. Results: Children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection than those with normal weight (71% obese vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.013; 68% overweight vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.004).

Obese children <6 months showed higher plasma leptin level than normal weight children (7.58 vs. 5.12 ng/μl; p <0.046). Conclusions: In infants younger than 6 months, overnutrition condition was related to increased severity of infections and high plasma leptin level. Also, children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection and low RSV viral load compared to normal weights children.

Not surprisingly, disruption of glycan synthesis is fundamental to various human diseases; including cancer, where aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mannose-binding lectin, ML6, which selectively recognizes and binds to these irregular tumor-specific glycans to elicit potent and rapid cancer cell death. This lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), each with a unique amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ML6 displays antitumor activity that is >10(5) times more potent than standard chemotherapeutics, while being almost completely inactive towards non-transformed, healthy cells. This activity, in combination with results from glycan binding studies, suggests ML6 differentiates healthy and malignant cells by exploiting divergent glycosylation pathways that yield naïve and incomplete cell surface glycans in tumors. Thus, ML6 and other high-valence lectins may serve as novel biochemical tools to elucidate the glycomic signature of different human tumors and aid in the rational design of carbohydrate-directed therapies. Further, understanding how nature evolves proteins, like ML6, to combat the changing defenses of competing microorganisms may allow for fundamental advances in the way we approach combinatorial therapies to fight therapeutic resistance in cancer.","time":1582610400000,"url":"10.1371/journal.pone.0229467","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A Mini-Review on the Epidemiology of Canine Parvovirus in China","source":"Front Vet Sci","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"CPV-2c","category":"Nation"},{"term":"CPV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CPV-2","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mini-Review","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Canine viral diarrhea is a severe disease in dogs worldwide.

MiRNAs contribute to RNA virus pathogenesis by promoting antiviral immune response, enhancing viral replication, or altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation. Thus, exploration of the virus–miRNA interactions occurring in PHEV-infected host may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms combating the virus life cycle or pathogenesis. Here, we discovered that the expression of miR-10a-5p was constitutively up-regulated by PHEV in both the N2a cells in vitro and mice brain in vivo. Treatment with miR-10a-5p mimics allowed miR-10a-5p enrichment and resulted in a significant restriction in PHEV replication, suggesting widespread negative regulation of the RNA virus infection by miR-10a-5p. The outcomes were also evidenced by miR-10a-5p inhibitor over-expression. Luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting analysis further showed that Syndecan 1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan associated with host defense mechanisms, acts as a target gene of miR-10a-5p during PHEV infection. Naturally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1 leads to a reduction in viral replication, implying that SDC1 expression is likely a favorable condition for viral replication. Together, the findings demonstrated that the abundant miR-10a-5p leads to downstream suppression of SDC1, and it functions as an antiviral mechanism in the PHEV-induced disease, providing a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of PHEV infection in the future work.","time":1582178400000,"url":"10.3389/fmicb.2020.00105","urlToImage":""},{"title":"16S rRNA gene sequencing reveals an altered composition of the gut microbiota in chickens infected with a nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus","source":"Sci Rep","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"NIBV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"INC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IIBV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Enterobacteriaceae","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clostridia","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chloroplast","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes serious losses to the poultry industry.

To understand AAVs distribution and genetic diversity in the coastal areas of Southeast China, a total of 415 intestine samples were mostly collected from two provinces of southeast China, i.e., Zhejiang and Fujian province. Intestine samples from five bat species were collected for AAVs detection. The average prevalence rate for AAV detection among these samples was 18.6% (77 positives out of 415 samples) and ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% between the five bat species. This suggests that AAVs are widely distributed in diverse bat populations in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1(BtAAV-CXC1) from one AAV-positive sample, the genetic diversity of the detected AAVs were assessed and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtAAV-CXC1 was comparatively distant to other major AAVs from mammals and non-mammals, with only a 52.9~64.7% nucleotide identity. However, they were phylogenetically closer to Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus (Rs-BtAAV1), with a 74.5% nt similarity. Partial analysis of the rep and cap overlapping open reading frame (ORF) sequences from bat AAV samples revealed 48 partial rep sequences and 23 partial cap sequences from positive samples shared 86.9 to 100% and 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves, respectively. This suggests that the detected AAVs had a distinctly high genetic diversity. These findings led us to conclude that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast regions of China.","time":1582869600000,"url":"10.1038/s41598-020-60721-z","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Molecular Diagnosis of Pneumonia Using Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assay RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST in a Group of Moroccan Infants","source":"Adv Virol","keywords":[{"term":"Morocco","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"RespiFinder","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SMART 22 FAST","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Group of Moroccan Infants","category":"Organization"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Mycoplasma","category":"Other"},{"term":"Molecular Diagnosis","category":"Other"},{"term":"Multiplex Real-Time","category":"Other"},{"term":"Assay RespiFinder","category":"Other"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the first cause of mortality due to infectious diseases. The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.","time":1582005600000,"url":"10.1155/2020/6212643","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Modelling the effective reproduction number of vector-borne diseases: the yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, Angola 2015–2016 as an example","source":"PeerJ","keywords":[{"term":"Dengue","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Zika","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Luanda","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Angola","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The burden of vector-borne diseases (Dengue, Zika virus, yellow fever, etc.) gradually increased in the past decade across the globe.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD ± 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.","time":1582092000000,"url":"10.1155/2020/9629747","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Pathogens Causing Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Less Than 5 Years of Age in Senegal","source":"Microbiol Insights","keywords":[{"term":"Senegal","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"RSV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Saharan Africa","category":"Location"}],"body":"INTRODUCTION: While acute respiratory tract infections are the main cause of paediatric mortality and morbidity worldwide, pathogen patterns shift due to factors such as hygiene, vaccinations, and antibiotic resistance. Knowledge about current cause of respiratory infections is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to identity the various respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age visiting a sub-urban primary care clinic in Senegal. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in September and October 2018. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from cases; infants with fever and respiratory symptoms, and controls; children involved in the vaccination programme. Viral identification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction for 21 different viruses; bacteria were identified by culture studies. Associations between microorganisms, acute respiratory infection and severity of disease were calculated by multivariate regression adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and living area. RESULTS: Overall, 102 cases and 96 controls were included. Microorganisms were detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls (P < .001). Influenza virus A (including H1N1), influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were independently associated with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of two or more pathogens was present in 49.5% of cases; 31.7% of cases had a pneumonia and 90.2% was treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study in a primary care setting in sub-Saharan Africa found influenza virus A and B, RSV, and S pneumoniae to be the main causes of acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age. We recommend evaluation of antibiotics prescription behaviour in this setting.","time":1577685600000,"url":"10.1177/1178636119890885","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Tumor‐associated macrophages secrete CC‐chemokine ligand 2 and induce tamoxifen resistance by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR in breast cancer","source":"Cancer Sci","keywords":[{"term":"Breast","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TAM","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the CM of MCF7‐S","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Akt/","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Akt","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Macrophages","category":"Other"},{"term":"receptor‐positive","category":"Other"},{"term":"Tamoxifen","category":"Other"},{"term":"CC‐chemokine","category":"Other"}],"body":"Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Although endocrine therapy is effective, the development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor malignancy, and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM) within the TME play a crucial role in endocrine resistance. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between TAM and the endocrine‐resistant phenotype of breast cancer. Macrophages were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from tamoxifen‐sensitive (MCF7‐S) or ‐resistant (MCF7‐R) MCF7 breast cancer cells. M2 polarization was detected by CD163 immunofluorescence. To determine the effect on endocrine resistance, MCF7 cells were cultured in the supernatant of different TAM, and then treated with tamoxifen. CC‐chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from 100 patients with invasive estrogen receptor‐positive breast cancer. We found that macrophages cultured in the CM of MCF7‐S and MCF7‐R cells were induced into TAM, with a more obvious M2 polarization in the latter. Tamoxifen resistance was increased by culture in TAM medium. TAM secreted CCL2, which increased endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. High expression of CCL2 was correlated with infiltration of CD163+macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001), and patients with high CCL2 expression presented shorter progression‐free survival than those with low CCL2 expression (P < .05). We conclude that CCL2 secreted by TAM activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and promotes an endocrine resistance feedback loop in the TME, suggesting that CCL2 and TAM may be novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine‐resistant breast cancer.","time":1579413600000,"url":"10.1111/cas.14230","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical findings and treatment of disseminated ‘Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis’ infection in a domestic cat","source":"J Vet Med Sci","keywords":[{"term":"Mycobacterium","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mycobacterium","category":"Nation"}],"body":"A cat was referred because of diffuse parenchymal lung disease.

Humoral immune response depression is due to perturbation of soluble factors, as complement and chemokines in innate immunity and antibodies or cytokines in adaptive immunity. At the cellular immune response, immunosuppression is the consequence of the dysfunction of T-cells, B-cells, heterophils, monocytes, macrophages, and natural Killer cells. Immunosuppression in turkeys can be caused by numerous, non-infectious, and infectious agents, having variable pathological and molecular mechanisms. Interactions between them are very complex. This paper reviews the common viruses inducing clinical and sub-clinical immunosuppression in turkeys, and enteric and neoplastic viruses in particular, as well as the interactions among them. The evaluation of immunosuppression is currently based on classical approach; however, new technique such as the microarray technology is being developed to investigate immunological mediator’s genes detection. Controlling of immunosuppression include, in general, biosecurity practices, maintaining appropriate breeding conditions and vaccination of breeders and their progeny. Nevertheless, few vaccines are available against immunosuppressive viruses in turkey’s industry.

METHODS: Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats diagnosed with AMG between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion. Inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase, and a CBC.

The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and BMAL1 in BMSCs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. ALP and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were also performed. Icariin promoted BMSC proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMAL1. In addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were upregulated by BMAL1 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that BMAL1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. Finally, ARS staining of BMAL1(−/−) BMSCs revealed that BMAL1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMAL1-BMP2 signaling in BMSCs.

By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention.

However, brain RAS is an independent form of RAS expressed locally in the brain, which is known to be involved in brain functions and disorders. There is strong evidence for a major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT-1R) axis in increased activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated strong neuroprotective effects by blocking AT1R in these brain disorders. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (1–7)/Mas receptor (MASR), is another axis of brain RAS which counteracts the damaging effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on neurons in the brain. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and activation of ACE2/Angiotensin (1–7)/MASR axis may serve as an exciting and novel method for neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here in this review article, we discuss the expression of RAS in the brain and highlight how altered RAS level may cause neurodegeneration. Understanding the pathophysiology of RAS and their links to neurodegeneration has enormous potential to identify potentially effective pharmacological tools to treat neurodegenerative diseases in the brain.","time":1585544400000,"url":"10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.01.026","urlToImage":""},{"title":"In Memoriam: Jay Stephen Keystone (1943–2019)","source":"Emerg Infect Dis","keywords":[{"term":"Memoriam","category":"Other"},{"term":"Jay Stephen Keystone","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1577858400000,"url":"10.3201/eid2601.191500","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Hunters Searching among Starry Nights and at the Edges of Life","source":"Emerg Infect Dis","keywords":[{"term":"Starry Nights","category":"Other"},{"term":"the Edges of Life","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1577858400000,"url":"10.3201/eid2601.AC2601","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Complete Genome Sequence of Bordetella bronchiseptica Strain KM22","source":"Microbiol Resour Announc","keywords":[{"term":"KM22","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Bordetella bronchiseptica isolate KM22 has been used in experimental infections of swine as a model of clinical B. bronchiseptica infection and to study host-to-host transmission.

The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg to PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 ± 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 ± 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 ± 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2. Conclusion: • Sustaining and standardizing the accomplished work of data collection. • Implementing the prone positioning technique across other critical care units of Hamad Medical Corporation. • Keeping a record of minor complications associated with prone positioning and resolving them in further sessions. • Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning.","time":1580104800000,"url":"10.5339/qmj.2019.qccc.60","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Porcine Deltacoronavirus Infection and Transmission in Poultry, United States","source":"Emerg Infect Dis","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Poultry","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"IgY","category":"Other"}],"body":"Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in diverse host species.

While some IBV strains replicate locally, others can disseminate to various organs, including the kidney. Here, we elucidate the determinants for kidney tropism by studying interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral attachment protein spike from two IBV strains with different tropisms. Recombinantly produced RBDs from the nephropathogenic IBV strain QX and from the nonnephropathogenic strain M41 bound to the epithelial cells of the trachea. In contrast, only QX-RBD binds more extensively to cells of the digestive tract, urogenital tract, and kidneys. While removal of sialic acids from tissues prevented binding of all proteins to all tissues, binding of QX-RBD to trachea and kidney could not be blocked by preincubation with synthetic alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. The lack of binding of QX-RBD to a previously identified IBV-M41 receptor was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that tissue binding of QX-RBD is dependent on a different sialylated glycan receptor. Using chimeric RBD proteins, we discovered that the region encompassing amino acids 99 to 159 of QX-RBD was required to establish kidney binding. In particular, QX-RBD amino acids 110 to 112 (KIP) were sufficient to render IBV-M41 with the ability to bind to kidney, while the reciprocal mutations in IBV-QX abolished kidney binding completely. Structural analysis of both RBDs suggests that the receptor-binding site for QX is located at a different location on the spike than that of M41. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. Upon infection of chicken flocks, the poultry industry faces substantial economic losses by diminished egg quality and increased morbidity and mortality of infected animals. While all IBV strains infect the chicken respiratory tract via the ciliated epithelial layer of the trachea, some strains can also replicate in the kidneys, dividing IBV into the following two pathotypes: nonnephropathogenic (example, IBV-M41) and nephropathogenic viruses (including IBV-QX). Here, we set out to identify the determinants for the extended nephropathogenic tropism of IBV-QX. Our data reveal that each pathotype makes use of a different sialylated glycan ligand, with binding sites on opposite sides of the attachment protein. This knowledge should facilitate the design of antivirals to prevent coronavirus infections in the field.","time":1578290400000,"url":"10.1128/JVI.01363-19","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Liver and Kidney Injuries in COVID-19 and Their Effects on Drug Therapy; a Letter to Editor","source":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","keywords":[{"term":"Kidney Injuries","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Their Effects on Drug Therapy","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Letter","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583712000000,"url":"","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Information Typology in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Crisis; a Commentary","source":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1583971200000,"url":"","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus Pandemic and Worries during Pregnancy; a Letter to Editor","source":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Pregnancy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Letter","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1584316800000,"url":"","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A Novel Coronavirus Outbreak from Wuhan City in China, Rapid Need for Emergency Departments Preparedness and Response; a Letter to Editor","source":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Letter","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Rapid Need","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1580601600000,"url":"","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Asthma in Pregnancy: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Whole-Course Management, and Medication Safety","source":"Can Respir J","keywords":[{"term":"Diagnosis","category":"Other"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Medication Safety","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Asthma in pregnancy is a health issue of great concern.

The application of classical computational methodologies, such as molecular docking, for the rational development of RNA-binding candidates is, however, complicated by the peculiarities characterizing these macromolecules, such as the marked conformational flexibility, the singular charges distribution, and the relevant role of solvent molecules. In this work, we have thus validated and extended the applicability domain of SuMD, an all-atoms molecular dynamics protocol that allows to accelerate the sampling of molecular recognition events on a nanosecond timescale, to ribonucleotide targets of pharmaceutical interest. In particular, we have proven the methodological ability by reproducing the binding mode of viral or prokaryotic ribonucleic complexes, as well as that of artificially engineered aptamers, with an impressive degree of accuracy.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.3389/fchem.2020.00107","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Antiviral and Anti-inflammatory Effects of Puerarin in Piglets Infected With Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","source":"Front Immunol","keywords":[{"term":"Puerarin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Yunnan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Gegen","category":"Other"},{"term":"Control","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Antiviral","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Anti-inflammatory Effects","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NF-κB","category":"Location"}],"body":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused enormous economic losses to the swine industry worldwide in recent years. Puerarin (PR), a major isoflavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Gegen, possesses many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. This study was conducted with both PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and neonatal pigs to determine the effect of PR on PEDV infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by using proteomic analyses. Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and PEDV + PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV + PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5 and 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer. On day 9, piglets were orally administered with either sterile saline or PEDV (Yunnan province strain) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 12 of the trial, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. In addition, Vero cells were assigned randomly into three groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV + PR). Cells in the PEDV and PEDV + PR groups were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, while cells in the control group were treated with the same volume of sterile saline. One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in serum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV + PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in vitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the abundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins. Western blot analyses showed that PR supplementation inhibited the PEDV-induced NF-κB activation. Collectively, these results indicate that PR could exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in piglets infected with PEDV and have the potential to be an effective antiviral feed additive.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.3389/fimmu.2020.00169","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The Multifunctional Long-Distance Movement Protein of Pea Enation Mosaic Virus 2 Protects Viral and Host Transcripts from Nonsense-Mediated Decay","source":"mBio","keywords":[{"term":"NMD","category":"Nation"},{"term":"PEMV2","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Nicotiana","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pea","category":"Organization"},{"term":"UTR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GC-rich","category":"Organization"},{"term":"The Multifunctional Long-Distance Movement Protein of Pea Enation Mosaic Virus 2 Protects Viral","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RNA-seq","category":"Other"},{"term":"Host Transcripts","category":"Other"}],"body":"The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway presents a challenge for RNA viruses with termination codons that precede extended 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3′ UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plant’s vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3′ UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor.","time":1583798400000,"url":"10.1128/mBio.00204-20","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Vaccine-Induced Th1-Type Response Protects against Invasive Group A Streptococcus Infection in the Absence of Opsonizing Antibodies","source":"mBio","keywords":[{"term":"Streptococcus","category":"Other"},{"term":"GAS","category":"Other"},{"term":"Combo5","category":"Other"},{"term":"Vaccine-Induced Th1-Type Response Protects","category":"Other"},{"term":"GAS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SMQ","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IFN-γ","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Invasive Group","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Absence of Opsonizing Antibodies","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TNF-α","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Recent global advocacy efforts have highlighted the importance of development of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS).

Based on major changes in the survival times, a quantitative-trait locus (QTL) was mapped on murine chromosome 3 to the genomic interval of Mb 110.4 to 120.5. Within this locus, composed of 31 protein-coding genes, two candidate genes, namely, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (Dpyd) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1pr1), were identified according to the level of genome-wide significance and disease gene prioritization. Functional validation of the S1pr1 gene by pharmacological targeting in C57BL/6NCrl mice confirmed its relevance in P. aeruginosa pathophysiology.

To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3).

SADS-CoV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and reduction in SADS-CoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway.

METHOD: A retrospective folder review of children hospitalised with LRTI between January and June 2015 was conducted, extracting data on demographic characteristics, health condition, ACT interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1208 individual cases (median [IQR] age 7.6 (2.8–19.0) months), in 1440 hospitalisations, were included. The majority of children were hospitalised primarily for the management of bronchiolitis. Comorbidities were present in 52.6% of patients during at least one of their hospitalisations.

Expressed resistance against eight classes of antibiotic was detected, with those for MLS, Bla, Tet, Phe at relatively high abundance. In summary, we used a simple total RNA sequencing approach to reveal the complex polymicrobial infectome in ARI. This provided comprehensive and clinically informative information relevant to understanding respiratory disease.","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1038/s41598-020-60992-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Are countries’ self-reported assessments of their capacity for infectious disease control reliable?

METHODS: Countries’ self-reported assessments implemented by percentages as IHR Monitoring Tools (IHRMT) in 2016 and 2017 were used to represent national capacity regarding infectious disease control. WHO Disease Outbreak News and matched diseases reports on ProMED-mail were collected in 2016 to represent disease control outcomes of countries. Disease control outcomes were divided in good, normal and bad groups based on the development of outbreaks listed in the reports. The Human Development Index (HDI), density of physicians and nurses, health expenditure, number of arrivals of international tourists were also collected for control. Chi-square test and logistic regression were applied for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 907 cases occurred in 92 countries. For all diseases, cases occurring in high international travel volume countries presented twice the risk of having a bad disease control outcomes than cases occurring in low international travel volume countries (OR = 2.19 for IHR 2016, OR = 2.97 for IHR 2017). Cases occurring in low IHR average score countries had significant higher risk (OR = 7.83 for IHR 2016 and OR = 2.23 for IHR 2017) of having a bad disease control outcomes than countries with high IHR average scores. For only human diseases, cases occurring in high international travel volume countries presented twice the risk of having a bad disease control outcomes than cases occurring in low international travel volume countries for IHR 2017 (OR = 2.79).

The HDI, health workforce density and total health expenditure were all positively associated with disease control outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Countries’ self-reported infectious disease control capacities positively correlated with their disease control outcomes. While the self-reported IHR scores were accountable to some degree, this approach was useful for understanding global capacity in infectious disease control and in allocating resources for future preparedness.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1186/s12889-020-8359-8","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Field trial to evaluate the effect of an intranasal respiratory vaccine protocol on bovine respiratory disease incidence and growth in a commercial calf rearing unit","source":"BMC Vet Res","keywords":[{"term":"BRD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BRD (OR 1.341","category":"Organization"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continues to be great challenge in calf rearing units. The urgent need to decrease the use of antibiotics and increase animal welfare in beef production has forced us to introduce new preventive methods. Vaccinations could contribute to the solution, but the high incidence of BRD already at an early age has made it difficult to introduce suitable vaccination programs. Challenge studies have shown promising results in 3–14 day old calves vaccinated with intranasal BRD vaccine, but very few field trials are available to assess the efficacy of the intranasal vaccines in field conditions. We evaluated the effect of one dose of commercial intranasal vaccination on calf mortality, daily gain, and treatment incidence for BRD in one calf rearing unit. In total, 497 calves (mean age 19 days) were included in our study, 247 of which were vaccinated at the time of arrival to the unit and 250 served as negative controls (unvaccinated). Vaccinated and unvaccinated calves were situated in separate compartments until weaning. Daily gain, treatment incidence, and mortality were recorded until the calves were transported to the finishing unit, which averaged 154.5 days from arrival. RESULTS: Average daily gain over the complete study period was 1151.9 g/day (SD 137.9) for the vaccinated calves and 1139.5 g/day (SD 135.9) for the unvaccinated calves. Intranasal vaccination combined with older arrival age (17 days or older) resulted in a higher daily gain (47.8 g/day) compared with unvaccinated calves (coef. 0.0478, p = 0.003). This association was not recorded in calves that were younger than 17 days upon arrival. Intranasal vaccination was not significantly associated either with mortality (OR 0.976, p = 0.968) or treatment incidence for BRD (OR 1.341, p = 0.120). In total, six vaccinated calves (2.43%) and six unvaccinated calves (2.40%) died during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating arriving calves with intranasal vaccine in the calf rearing unit did not decrease the mortality or treatment incidence for BRD, but it significantly improved the weight gain in calves transported to the unit at the age of 17 days or older.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1186/s12917-020-02294-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"PPARγ and Its Agonists in Chronic Kidney Disease","source":"Int J Nephrol","keywords":[{"term":"CKD","category":"Nation"},{"term":"PPARγ","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chronic Kidney Disease","category":"Other"}],"body":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a global healthcare issue.

Novel treatments that can induce a protective immune response are urgently needed to effectively control the HBV epidemic and eventually eradicate chronic HBV infection. METHODS: We designed and evaluated an HBV therapeutic vaccine consisting of a novel Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist T7-EA, an Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein. We used RNA-seq, ELISA and hTLR7/8 reporting assays to characterize T7-EA in vitro and real-time PCR to evaluate the tissue-retention characteristics in vivo. To evaluate the adjuvant potential, we administrated T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with an Alum adjuvant and HBsAg in normal and HBV mice, then, we evaluated the HBsAg-specific immune responses by ELISA and Elispot assays. RESULTS: T7-EA acted as an hTLR7-specific agonist and induced a similar gene expression pattern as an unmodified TLR7 ligand when Raw 264.7 cells were exposed to T7-EA; however, T7-EA was more potent than the unmodified TLR7 ligand. In vivo studies showed that T7-EA had tissue-retaining activity with stimulating local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days. T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and a T-cell response in normal mice compared to mice received traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine.

The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the classic flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains.

While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-{gamma} by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-{gamma} and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17-mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

We confirm that the expression level of IFITM3 plays a role in determining the level of viral infection through manipulation of IFITM3 levels with interferon (IFN) stimulation and overexpression systems. Low basal expression may put some immune cells, including lymphocytes and lung-resident macrophages, at risk of influenza virus infection. Investigating the induction of IFITM3 by IFN, we find a strong preference for Type I IFN in IFITM3 induction in both cell lines and primary human cells. While myeloid cells can increase expression following stimulation by Type I IFN, lymphocytes show minimal induction of IFITM3 following IFN stimulation, suggesting that they are always at risk of viral infection. Surprisingly, we found that the time it takes for maximal induction of IFITM3 is relatively slow for an interferon-stimulated gene at around 36 hours. Low basal expression and slow induction of IFITM3 could increase the risk of influenza virus infection in selected immune cells. ImportanceInfluenza virus infection remains one of the top ten threats to global health, causing significant deaths and hospitalisations across the world each year. Understanding mechanisms for controlling influenza virus infection remain a priority. The interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3 can restrict influenza infection by limiting replication of the virus. The precise mechanisms of how IFITM3 reduced replication of influenza are unknown, although it is predicted to prevent release of viral contents into the cytosol by preventing pore formation on the endosomal compartments where it is suggested to reside. Here we have shown that the expression level of IFITM3 is important in determining the control of influenza virus infection. We find an expression pattern for IFITM3 that varies based on cell type, tissue locality, differentiation state and cell naivety, all of which highlights cells that may be at the highest risk of influenza infection.","time":1577059200000,"url":"10.1101/2019.12.20.885590","urlToImage":""},{"title":"SPINT2 inhibits proteases involved in activation of both influenza viruses and metapneumoviruses","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"SPINT2","category":"Location"},{"term":"A/Aichi/68","category":"Organization"},{"term":"KLK5","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SPINT2","category":"Organization"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"TMPRSS2","category":"Other"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Viruses possessing class I fusion proteins require proteolytic activation by host cell proteases to mediate fusion with the host cell membrane.

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. Author SummaryInfectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.","time":1578441600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.01.07.896977","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Altered polarization of PAR-2 signaling during airway epithelial remodeling","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"BackgroundProtease","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ALI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ConclusionsSquamous","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ObjectiveWe","category":"Other"},{"term":"ALI","category":"Other"}],"body":"BackgroundProtease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) is activated by proteases involved in allergy and triggers airway epithelial secretion and inflammation.

The interaction between MHC-I and {beta}2m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking and CD8 binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that infect pandas were concretely clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional structure of pAime-128. The distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family. IMPORTANCEUrsidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, the study of its immunology, especially structural immunology, is extremely rare to date. In this paper, we first crystallized the key complex pMHC-I, taking the giant panda as its representative species. Structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complexes, contains the unique pockets of PBG were analyzed in detail. Comparison of the panda pMHC-I in the bear family and other mammals, almost definite features was displayed. Meanwhile, the interaction between HC and LV, the unique features of pMHC-I in the CD8 binding and TCR docking, validation of anchor site in the PBG, and epitopes of potential viruses infected with the pandas, were concretely clarified. These unique characteristics of pMHC-I clearly indicate an unusual situation during the evolution of MHC molecules in the endangered pandas. These results also provide a novel platform for further study of panda T cell immunology and vaccines.","time":1579132800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.01.15.908608","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Programmable low-cost DNA-based platform for viral RNA detection","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Zika","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Viral detection is critical for controlling disease spread and progression.

The mechanisms that lead to mortality in these children are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of pneumonia. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data. MethodsUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified > 1,000 proteins expressed in the airways of children who were admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia. 61 of these children were discharged from hospital and survived for more than 365 days after discharge, while 19 died during admission. We used machine learning by random forest to derive protein features that could be used to deconvolve immune cell phenotypes in paediatric airway samples. We applied these phenotype-specific signatures to identify airway-resident immune cell phenotypes that were differentially enriched by survival status and validated the findings using a large retrospective pneumonia cohort. Main ResultsWe identified immune-cell phenotype classification features for 33 immune cell types. Eosinophil-associated features were significantly elevated in airway samples obtained from pneumonia survivors and were downregulated in children who subsequently died. To confirm these results, we analyzed clinical parameters from >10,000 children who had been admitted with pneumonia in the previous 10 years. The results of this retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data and showed that survivors had significantly elevated eosinophils at admission compared to fatal pneumonia. ConclusionsUsing a proteomics bioinformatics approach, we identify airway eosinophils as a critical factor for pneumonia survival in infants and young children.","time":1579392000000,"url":"10.1101/840090","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for lineage B β-coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness.

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication. ImportanceNo antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses.

Knowledge about how distinct types of muscarinic GPCR signaling regulate microglia function in vitro and in vivo is still poor, partly due to the fact that some of these receptors are also present in astrocytes and neurons. We generated mice expressing the hM3Dq Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) selectively in microglia to investigate the role of muscarinic M3Gq-linked signaling. We show that activation of hM3Dq using clozapine N-oxide (CNO) elevated intracellular calcium levels and increased phagocytosis of FluoSpheres in vitro. Acute treatment with CNO in vivo did not affect male mouse behavior, however chronic CNO treatment decreased sickness behavior triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Interestingly, whereas acute treatment with CNO increased synthesis of cytokine mRNA, chronic treatment attenuated LPS-induced cytokine mRNA changes in the brain, likely explaining the improvement in sickness behavior by chronic hM3Dq activation. No effect of CNO was observed in DREADD-negative mice. These results suggest that chronic activation of M3 muscarinic receptors (the hM3Dq progenitor) in microglia, and potentially other Gq-coupled GPCRs, preconditions microglia to decrease their response to further immunological challenges. Our results indicate that hM3Dq can be a useful tool to modulate neuroinflammation and study microglial immunological memory in vivo, which may be applicable for manipulations of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

The recent outbreaks of Zika virus, Ebola virus and Corona virus are examples of viral zoonosis, which occur more frequently due to globalization. In the case of a virus outbreak, it is helpful to know which host organism was the original carrier of the virus. Once the reservoir or intermediate host is known, it can be isolated to prevent further spreading of the viral infection. Recent approaches aim to predict a viral host based on the viral genome, often in combination with the potential host genome and arbitrarily selected features. These methods have a clear limitation in either the number of different hosts they can predict or the accuracy of their prediction. ResultsHere, we present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral host prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence only. To ensure a high prediction accuracy, we developed an effective selection approach for the training data to avoid biases due to a highly unbalanced number of known sequences per virus-host combinations. We tested our deep neural network on three different virus species (influenza A, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A). We reached for each virus species an AUG between 0.93 and 0.98, outperforming previous approaches and allowing highly accurate predictions while only using fractions (100-400 bp) of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural networks are suitable to predict the host of a virus, even with a limited amount of sequences and highly unbalanced available data.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.

In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM).

Here we demonstrate that targeting the RNase that degrades R-loops, which cause DNA breaks, exacerbates the cost of resistance. Consequently, lack of RNase HI function drives resistant clones to extinction in populations with high initial frequency of resistance, both in laboratory conditions and in a mouse model of gut colonization. Thus, RNase HI provides a target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validate using a repurposed drug.

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking.

The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution.

PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. ImportanceCoronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","time":1580774400000,"url":"10.1101/782409","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Genomic variance of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Bat","category":"Other"},{"term":"BCoV","category":"Other"},{"term":"Serine/Leucine","category":"Organization"}],"body":"There is rising global concern for the recently emerged novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov).

By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China.

A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. ResultsWe trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. AvailabilityThe repository of this project will be published.

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.

What This Study Adds to the FieldWe compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.","time":1581552000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.01.25.919787","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Identification of a pangolin niche for a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus through an extensive meta-metagenomic search","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"the NCBI Sequence Read Archive","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ImportanceMeta","category":"Organization"},{"term":"F.

Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro.

CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes.

Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation.

We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system.

In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV.

These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain.

Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments.

Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.

Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs.

Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems. Our approach requires some knowledge of the parameter space and exposes the similarities between renewal and skyline models.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1101/703751","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Artesunate interacts with Vitamin D receptor to reverse mouse model of sepsis-induced immunosuppression via enhancing autophagy","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"PurposeImmunosuppression","category":"Organization"},{"term":"VDR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pseudomonas Aeruginosa","category":"Organization"},{"term":"LPS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ImplicationsOur","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NF-{kappa}B","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Vitamin D","category":"Other"}],"body":"Background and PurposeImmunosuppression is the predominant cause of mortality for sepsis due to failure to eradicate invading pathogens. Unfortunately, no effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are available for clinical use. Increasing evidence implicates vitamin D receptor (VDR) involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Herein, artesunate (AS) was discovered to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression and its molecular mechanism is investigated. Experimental ApproachEffect of artesunate on sepsis-induced immunosuppression was investigated in mice and in vitro. VDR was predicted to be an interacted candidate of AS by bioinformatics predict, then identified using PCR and immunoblotting. VDR, ATG16L1 and NF-{kappa}B p65 were modified to investigate the alteration of ASs effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines release, bacteria clearance and autophagy activities in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Key ResultsAS significantly reduced the mortality of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis immunosuppression mice challenged with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR, then influencing ATG16L1 transcription and subsequent autophagy activity. In addition, AS inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-{kappa}B p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B p65, which activated the transcription of NF-{kappa}B p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity.

In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the bag-of-words model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the bag-of-words approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of bag-of-words methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative degenerate K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A.

In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [R] = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively.

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.04.975995","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Rapid metagenomic characterization of a case of imported COVID-19 in Cambodia","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Illumina","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Cambodia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Cambodias","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Rapid production and publication of pathogen genome sequences during emerging disease outbreaks provide crucial public health information.

Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively.

The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo.

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, MyCoV, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.

Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1. Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes.","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.09.984393","urlToImage":""},{"title":"An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors' CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"West Africa EBOV","category":"Nation"},{"term":"EBOV","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Targeting","category":"Nation"},{"term":"EBOV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the EBOV NP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"YQVNNLEEI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"EBOV NP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CTL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors'","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date.

These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.986109","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Rigidity, normal modes and flexible motion of a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) protease structure","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"PDB","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"AbstractThe rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations.

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals.

The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Rigorous data analysis was done with curated NVIs for prioritizing druglike compounds. For the same, more than 1800 descriptors of NVIs were computed and comparative analysis was performed with the FDA approved small molecules and antivirals. These compounds were further evaluated through PAINS filter to study their toxicity profile. Simultaneously, compounds were also prioritized based on the robustness of the assays through which they were identified.ResultsOur efforts lead to the creation of a well-curated structured knowledgebase of 182 NVIs with 98 small molecule inhibitors.

Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification.

Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.","time":1584230400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.13.991083","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Development of CRISPR as a prophylactic strategy to combat novel coronavirus and influenza","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"CRISPR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"ABSTRACTThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since December 2019.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein plays the key role in the tight binding to human ACE2 for viral entry. In this study, we analyzed the worldwide RBD mutations and found 10 mutants under high positive selection pressure during the spread. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of three RBD mutants emerging in Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and France were two orders of magnitude lower than the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 strain due to the stabilization of the beta-sheet scaffold of the RBD. This indicated that the mutated viruses have evolved to acquire remarkably increased infectivity. Five France isolates and one Hong Kong isolate shared the same RBD mutation enhancing the binding affinity, which suggested that they may have originated as a novel sub-lineage. The KD values for the bat and the pangolin SARS-like CoV RBDs indicated that it would be difficult and unlikely for this bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans; however, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans with respect to its RBD. These analyses of critical mutations of the RBD provide further insights into the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2, presumably while under selection pressure.

Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.

Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures.

In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.","time":1580860800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Using predicted imports of 2019-nCoV cases to determine locations that may not be identifying all imported cases","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Cases from the ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) exported from mainland China can lead to self-sustained outbreaks in other populations.

We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","time":1581379200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107","urlToImage":""},{"title":"ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Angiotensin","category":"Other"}],"body":"Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries.

We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","time":1581033600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.05.20020792","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hong Kong","category":"Location"},{"term":"Taiwan","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Macau","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","time":1581379200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"CRRT","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Until 24:00 of February 7th 2020, 31774 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have been reported, including 6101 severe cases in critical conditions and 722 deaths. The critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. It has been recently known that the 2019-nCoV shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on SARS which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). Here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. Together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-nCov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality.","time":1581465600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number of COVID-19 Outbreak in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Poisson","category":"Organization"},{"term":"EGR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SIR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention.

By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","time":1581379200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.09.20021261","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Spatially Explicit Modeling of 2019-nCoV Epidemic Trend based on Mobile Phone Data in Mainland China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Spatially Explicit Modeling","category":"Other"},{"term":"Epidemic Trend","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mobile Phone Data","category":"Organization"}],"body":"IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","time":1581379200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Assessing the Tendency of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Outbreak in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Since December 8, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day.

There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data.

Nevertheless, estimating R0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.","time":1581465600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.10.20021725","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Statistical Inference for Coronavirus Infected Patients in Wuhan","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wenzhou City","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Wenzhou","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Statistical Inference","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Importance: The new coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected the quality of life in China.

Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","time":1581465600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood of 123 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Lymphocyte","category":"Nation"},{"term":"CD8+T","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients.

We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6 based on confirmed cases and ~2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population.

During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. RESULTS: Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without. CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.","time":1581638400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Chernivtsi","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Ukraine","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SIR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background.

For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989.

Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods: We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings: Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202).

Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown.

Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity.

Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.","time":1581552000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City: China, January-February, 2020","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"IFR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. Results: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%).

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.","time":1581638400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Probabilistic reconstruction of measles transmission clusters from routinely collected surveillance data","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead to large transmission clusters.

Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.","time":1581638400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Analysis of meteorological conditions and prediction of epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV infection in 2020","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Zhejiang","category":"Location"},{"term":"Pearl River Delta","category":"Location"},{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Beijing","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Tianjin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hebei","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Jiangsu","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shanghai","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Zhengzhou","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Celsius","category":"Other"}],"body":"Objective: To investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of 2019-nCoV infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease. Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","time":1581984000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"the Northern Hemisphere","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"OC43","category":"Nation"},{"term":"HKU1","category":"Organization"}],"body":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","time":1581897600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimating the distribution of the incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection between travelers to Hubei, China and non-travelers","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MLE","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Objectives: Amid the continuing spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the incubation period of COVID-19 should be regularly re-assessed as more information is available upon the increase in reported cases.

The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.","time":1581897600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A new transmission route for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shenzhen","category":"Nation"}],"body":"We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread.

Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases.

Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","time":1581897600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China.

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.15.20023457","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimating the Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 using Cases from Outside China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Cases","category":"Organization"}],"body":"There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China.

The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614","urlToImage":""},{"title":"SEIR Transmission dynamics model of 2019 nCoV coronavirus with considering the weak infectious ability and changes in latency duration","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SEIR","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SEIR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SEIR Transmission","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Euler","category":"Location"}],"body":"Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability.

People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method.

Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed.

At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.16.20023820","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which may be associated with disease severity.

The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.17.20024018","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Epidemic Situation of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China mainland","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Epidemic Situation of Novel","category":"Organization"}],"body":"[Objective] Analyze the occurrence of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) in China mainland, explore the epidemiological rules, and evaluate the effect of prevention and control.

[Results] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 54,406 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 37,914 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline.

An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-of-outbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.17.20024042","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimating number of global importations of COVID-19 from Wuhan, risk of transmission outside mainland China and COVID-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Thailand","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Indonesia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date.

We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimation of the epidemic properties of the 2019 novel coronavirus: A mathematical modeling study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background The 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"PHEIC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Intensive care unit","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CD8+T","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Functional Exhaustion","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"TNF-α","category":"Nation"}],"body":"BACKGROUND The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (≥60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, or 400/μL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, and 400/μL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^μ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents μ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024414","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Psychological responses, behavioral changes and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population based cross-sectional survey","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shanghai","category":"Nation"},{"term":"n=320","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out).

Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024570","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Association of Population Migration and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic Control","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Objective","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CDC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Aggregated","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Baidu Migration","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Level 1 Response","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Association of Population Migration","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hefei","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shenzhen","category":"Nation"},{"term":"p=0.000","category":"Nation"},{"term":"r=0.217","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"r=-0.452","category":"Other"},{"term":"r=0.536","category":"Other"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Background and Objective To analyze the impact of different patterns of migration flow in two cities, Hefei and Shenzhen, on the epidemic and disease control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies. Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4±15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15±17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","time":1582156800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Early Phylogenetic Estimate Of The Effective Reproduction Number Of 2019-nCoV","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"GISAID","category":"Organization"},{"term":"The Effective Reproduction Number Of","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"To reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of the 2019 novel coronavirus, 52 2019−nCOV genomes available on 04 February 2020 at GISAID were analysed.

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days).

Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset.

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city.

However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22/25, 88%).

Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P > 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effectiveness of control strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019: a SEIR dynamic modeling study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Chongqing","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Isse","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Huanggang","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Xiaogan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Jingzhou","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Xiangyang city","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Isse","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SEIR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: Since its first cases occurrence in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GAD","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019.

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical characteristics of 51 patients discharged from hospital with COVID-19 in Chongqing，China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Chongqing","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Lopinavir and Ritonavir","category":"Organization"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Lymphopenia","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Background：Since December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2（SARS-CoV-2）-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019，COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , China，and rapidly spread throughout China，even throughout the world.

Clinical records, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics and tables and graphs. Findings: Six SARS-related articles (N=337 participants) and 12 COVID-19-related articles (N=50,096 participants) were eligible for this systematic review. Fever, cough and Malaise/Fatigue were the most common symptoms in SARS and COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way, from person to person, asymptomatic infected people and possible fecal-oral transmission, created the conditions for a large-scale spread. The mortality rates of SARS and COVID-19 were (7.7%) and (2.2%) respectively, but the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 (3.9%) was lower than that of SARS (40.0%). We also summarize the current reports on the pathology of COVID-19, we found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. In general, COVID-19 is transmitted in more diverse ways and is more infectious, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker and patient is very important.

Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Breadth of concomitant immune responses underpinning viral clearance and patient recovery in a non-severe case of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"disease-19","category":"Other"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"IgM/IgG","category":"Organization"}],"body":"We report the kinetics of the immune response in relation to clinical and virological features of a patient with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) requiring hospitalisation.

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","time":1582502400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.20.20025874","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on the early global spread of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"IATA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases.

During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146","urlToImage":""},{"title":"2019 Novel Coronavirus can be detected in urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs samples","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"We tested samples collected from nine patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","time":1582416000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.21.20026328","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of March 5, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Trends in Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan and 29 Provinces in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Transmissibility of 2019","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID- 19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan. Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.22.20025320","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Development and Evaluation of A CRISPR-based Diagnostic For 2019-novel Coronavirus","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CRISPR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CRISPR-nCoV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Background: The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern.

Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72℃ and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70℃ and 12.42℃ respectively. The curves shared similar shapes.

Methods We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. Results The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19. Conclusions Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different.

And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.23.20024935","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The landscape of lung bronchoalveolar immune cells in COVID-19 revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BALF","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TCR-seq","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"scRNA-seq","category":"Other"}],"body":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of recently named Coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) by WHO, has caused more than 2, 000 deaths worldwide since its emergency in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019. The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 91 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang, China: A retrospective, multi-centre case series","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Epidemiologic","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chest","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Conclusions Social","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Zhejiang","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Zhejiang province","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Ningbo","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hospitalized Patients","category":"Other"}],"body":"Background Recent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei.

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Mental health status and coping strategy of medical workers in China during The COVID-19 outbreak","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"The authors have withdrawn their manuscript whilst they perform additional experiments to test some of their conclusions further.

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019. Conclusions The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.23.20026930","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical features and laboratory inspection of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in Xiangyang, Hubei","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Cough","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Xiangyang","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"ALT","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Creatinine (CR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"BUN","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"}],"body":"Background: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) rapidly spread in China, reached multiple continents currently.We aimed to reveal the infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research of novel coronavirus.

Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.24.20023325","urlToImage":""},{"title":"TWIRLS, an automated topic-wise inference method based on massive literature, suggests a possible mechanism via ACE2 for the pathological changes in the human host after coronavirus infection","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"TWIRLS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Renin-Angiotensin System","category":"Organization"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the coronavirus should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.24.20025437","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Demonstration of four entities of appendicitis in China through studying cluster/outbreak","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Fusobacterium","category":"Location"}],"body":"Objective: To differentiate different entities of appendicitis through studying cluster/outbreak, ascertain common setting of cluster/outbreak, and provide the epidemiological evidences of infectious etiology of appendicitis.

Methods: Field investigation for Tibetan students were carried out and reports published in English and Chinese medical journals were reviewed. Results: The literature review included 473 patients in 7 cluster/outbreaks of appendicitis in 6 provinces and autonomous regions. All the clusters/outbreaks occurred in group living units. We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from non perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis . In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium. The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes.

There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage.

During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019.

Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the best case outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","time":1582588800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.24.20027375","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Weibull","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Monte Caro","category":"Other"},{"term":"Gamma","category":"Other"}],"body":"Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Spread and control of COVID-19 in China and their associations with population movement, public health emergency measures, and medical resources","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Provincial","category":"Nation"},{"term":"City r=0.6358","category":"Nation"},{"term":"METHODS Spearman's","category":"Organization"},{"term":"City r=0.6311","category":"Organization"}],"body":"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Transmission potential of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) onboard the Diamond Princess Cruises Ship, 2020","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the Diamond Princess Ship","category":"Location"}],"body":"An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020.

We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results.

Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability.

The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the American Thoracic Society","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Intensive care unit","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COPD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staff Protection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"the First Hospital of Jilin University","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Medical Staff Protection","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection.

Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The definition and risks of Cytokine Release Syndrome-Like in 11 COVID-19-Infected Pneumonia critically ill patients: Disease Characteristics and Retrospective Analysis","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"}],"body":"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients with severe immune abnormalities and risk of cytokine release syndrome.

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20027938","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"}],"body":"Abstract Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Evaluation of the clinical characteristics of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 during home care with isolation: A new retrospective analysis based on O2O","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"O2O","category":"Other"},{"term":"Muscle","category":"Other"},{"term":"Lack","category":"Other"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Fever","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Dyspnea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"P<0.04","category":"Nation"},{"term":"O2O","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Summary Background The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Eastern Europe","category":"Location"},{"term":"Central America","category":"Location"},{"term":"South-Western Asia","category":"Location"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries.

The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"D-dimer","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MOF","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital′s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Community responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong: risk perception, information exposure and preventive measures","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Hong Kong","category":"Location"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the New Territories","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the Hospital Anxiety","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures.

This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas).

However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; α-HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Prediction of the Epidemic of COVID-19 Based on Quarantined Surveillance in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SEIR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Quarantined Surveillance","category":"Other"}],"body":"Background and Objective: To predict the epidemic of COVID-19 based on quarantined surveillance from real world in China by modified SEIR model different from the previous simply mathematical model.

It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission.

Methods: We screened the electronic records of 2,799 patients admitted in Tongji Hospital from January 10th to February 18th, 2020. There were 375 discharged patients including 201 survivors. We built a prognostic prediction model based on XGBoost machine learning algorithm and then tested 29 patients (included 3 patients from other hospital) who were cleared after February 19th.

Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R>1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Evaluation of Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Colloidal Gold- Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for Detection of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia (COVID-19)","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Enzyme-linked","category":"Other"},{"term":"ELISA","category":"Other"},{"term":"Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay","category":"Other"},{"term":"Colloidal","category":"Other"},{"term":"Immunochromatographic Assay Kit","category":"Other"},{"term":"GICA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ELISA IgM","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ELISA IgG","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GICA IgM","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GICA IgG","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ELISA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China.

Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Lymphopenia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"D-dimer","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chest","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Interpretation Lots","category":"Other"}],"body":"Background Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet.

Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2.

There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.28.20028555","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical significance of IgM and IgG test for diagnosis of highly suspected COVID-19 infection","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Quick","category":"Organization"},{"term":"P=0.0365","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Quick, simple and accurate diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is very important for the screening and therapy of patients.

Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal.

The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes.

Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001).

Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05).

Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001).

Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic.

However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Stay At Home Movement","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Baidu Migration","category":"Organization"},{"term":"e.g","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Provinces","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland.

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results：267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]).

Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%).

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in Ⅲ stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 - 328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 - 363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.01.20029611","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Risk estimation and prediction by modeling the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in mainland China excluding Hubei province","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April.

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical and Laboratory Profiles of 75 Hospitalized Patients with Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hefei, China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Anhui","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Hefei","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Anhui Province","category":"Nation"},{"term":"LYM","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the First Affiliated Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"USTC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hematological","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hospitalized Patients","category":"Other"}],"body":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China.

We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness.

Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04).

CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.02.20027599","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Monitoring Disease Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease in Zhejiang, China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Zhejiang","category":"Location"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"We monitored the transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang accounting the transmissions from imported cases.

Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly. Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia.

Influenza epidemics and pandemics cause significant morbidity and mortality. An effective response to a potential pandemic requires the infrastructure to rapidly detect, characterize, and potentially contain new and emerging influenza strains at a population level. The objective of this study is to use data gathered simultaneously from community and hospital sites to develop a model of how influenza enters and spreads in a population. Methods and Analysis. Starting in the 2018-19 season, we have been enrolling individuals with acute respiratory illness from community sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, including clinics, childcare facilities, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workplaces, college campuses, and homeless shelters. At these sites, we collect clinical data and mid-nasal swabs from individuals with at least two acute respiratory symptoms. Additionally, we collect residual nasal swabs and data from individuals who seek care for respiratory symptoms at four regional hospitals. Samples are tested using a multiplex molecular assay, and influenza whole genome sequencing is performed for samples with influenza detected. Geospatial mapping and computational modeling platforms are in development to characterize the regional spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens. Ethics and Dissemination.

In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score.

In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.02.20030007","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimation of COVID-19 outbreak size in Italy based on international case exportations","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Switzerland","category":"Nation"},{"term":"France","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Austria","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Croatia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Iran","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"North America","category":"Location"},{"term":"South America","category":"Location"},{"term":"the International Air Transport Association","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IATA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the United Nations World Tourism Organization","category":"Organization"},{"term":"UNWTO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Fraser","category":"Other"}],"body":"Italy is currently experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19 which emerged in the Lombardy region . During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Forecasting the Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Deaths in China: Can More Lives Be Saved?","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hong Kong","category":"Location"},{"term":"Boltzmann","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Boltzmann function","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CI 3187","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Richards","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is on-going in China and appears to approach late phase. It is highly demanding to estimate how many COVID-19 patients will die eventually. In this study, an estimate of the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces is provided. The results may help to eluate the severity of the epidemic and facilitate mental health care. Methods: Data of the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths from January 21 to February 29, 2020, released daily by the National Health Commission of China and Hubei Provincial Health Commission, were used. The Boltzmann function was explored to simulate the data in each region. By using these established functions, the potential total number of deaths were forecasted. In addition, data of the cumulative number of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were collected from the WHO official website and analyzed in a similar manner. A Monte Carlo technique was applied to analyze the uncertainty of the estimates of the cumulative confirmed cases, and the results are presented using the resulting mean, median, and a 95% confidence interval (CI). For comparison, the potential total numbers of deaths were estimated by Richards function-based regression analyses. Findings: The data of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths with respect to each region were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 for all the regression analyses being close to 0.999). Consistently, the data for the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. The potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, other provinces, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei were estimated to be 3260 (95% CI 3187, 3394), 110 (109, 112), 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 (607, 632), respectively. Similar results were obtained by Richards function-based regression analysis. Interpretation: The observation that the data of the cumulative numbers of deaths for both the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic in each geographic region were well fitted with the Boltzmann function strongly suggests that it is suitable for the simulation of deaths associated with coronaviruses-induced diseases. The estimation of COVID-19 deaths may help governments to evaluate the severity of the outbreak and also facilitate timely mental health care for the families of dead patients.","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.02.20030064","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimation of local novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan, China from off-site reported cases and population flow data from different sources","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Tencent","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Changjiang Daily","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Baidu","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Keyword","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset.

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.02.20030288","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Preliminary estimating the reproduction number of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Republic of Korea and Italy by 5 March 2020","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and Italy has caused 6088 cases and 41 deaths in Republic of Korea and 3144 cases and 107 death in Italy by 5 March 2020.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the World.","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SEIR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Baidu","category":"Organization"},{"term":"NPI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"World","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. Results: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. Conclusion: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Tianjin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Jan.21-Feb.27","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic.

Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin.

Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients.

We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection.

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18.

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019.

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.03.20030858","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on healthcare workers in China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Introduction Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 3000 (including clinical diagnosis) healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China.

Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age.

Methods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death.

METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group.

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma creatinine, and urea concentrations along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Among these 85 COVID-19 cases, 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), and elder patients (≥ 60 years old) are easier to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001). Comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001). Dynamic observation of eGFR revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of eGFR but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology or tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. CONCLUSIONS The development of ARF during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage, ARF and probably also lead to urine transmission.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China, constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level.

Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76).

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"COS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Criteria","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Randomized","category":"Other"}],"body":"Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field.

Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. For protocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27/76, 35.53%) outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17 outcome domains were reported; almost half (62/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40 (40/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. Conclusion: Outcome reporting in protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 is inconsistent. Thus, developing a core outcome set is necessary.

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.05.20031872","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and nursing college students during COVID-19 outbreak","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Anhui Province","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Brief COPE","category":"Other"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background: Affected by a Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, Since December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections.

The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (≤49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (≥70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (βvalue=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068).

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.06.20029793","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers Under the Outbreak of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"P=0.022","category":"Nation"},{"term":"fMW","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality","category":"Organization"},{"term":"P＜0.001","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"Athens Insomnia Scale","category":"Other"},{"term":"Visual Analogue Scale","category":"Other"},{"term":"PSQI","category":"Other"},{"term":"P＜0.001","category":"Other"}],"body":"Objective To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (fMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, and make a comparison with non-fMW.

Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Results A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 vs 7.5, P＜0.001), AIS (6.9 vs 5.3, P＜0.001), anxiety (4.9 vs 4.3, P＜0.001) and depression (4.1 vs 3.6, P=0.001), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (67.2% vs 47.7%, P＜0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%, P＜0.001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.4 vs 8.6, P=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (70.3% vs 54.6%, P<0.001). Conclusion fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW. Female fMW were more vulnerable to having sleep disturbances than male fMW.","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.06.20031278","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical Characteristics on 25 Discharged Patients with COVID-19 Virus Returning","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"D-Dimer","category":"Other"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Here we report the clinical features of 25 discharged patients with COVID-19 recovery.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. Keywords.

Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions.

We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile).

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised.

However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection.

Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone.

The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R​0<​1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R​0<​1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. We show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity.","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.08.20032946","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Australia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1st 2020.

Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic.

During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical features of imported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Tibetan patients in the Plateau area","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Qinghai","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Lymphocyte","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Plateau","category":"Location"}],"body":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread throughout China, but the clinical characteristics of Tibetan patients living in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are unknown.

Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation.

Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age.

A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%).

The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.09.20033415","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Lessons drawn from China and South Korea for managing COVID-19 epidemic: insights from a comparative modeling study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Guangdong","category":"Location"},{"term":"3.5,4.2","category":"Other"}],"body":"We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days.

The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020.

With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.09.20033498","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The time scale of asymptomatic transmission affects estimates of epidemic potential in the COVID-19 outbreak","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"R_0","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"We assess the impact of asymptomatic transmission on epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens (like COVID-19) -- as measured both by the basic reproduction number (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals.

If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estimated.

In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Revealing the influence of national public health policies for the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, China through status dynamic modeling","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Susceptible (S","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Exposed","category":"Nation"},{"term":"R_0","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Iran","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.","time":1583971200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Protocol for a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled nitric oxide therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Intensive care unit","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the Investigation Review Boards","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Xijing Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"The Partners Human Research Committee","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Massachusetts General Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Boston","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease. Trial registration.

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. Conclusion Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20033605","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Analysis clinical features of COVID-19 infection in secondary epidemic area and report potential biomarkers in evaluation","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wenzhou","category":"Location"},{"term":"P>0.05","category":"Other"},{"term":"SAA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Objective: Based on the clinical characteristics of infected patients with novel coronavirus in secondary epidemic areas,we aimed to identify potential biomarkers for the evaluation of novel coronavirus-infected patients,guide the diagnosis and treatment of this disease in secondary epidemic areas and provide a reference for the clinical prevention and control of this epidemic situation. Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients'histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed. Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P>0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein,monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein,neutrophil count/C-reactive protein,monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20033613","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The Prediction for Development of COVID-19 in Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends in China by Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Iran","category":"Nation"},{"term":"IFP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the National Health Commission","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Mar 6-Mar 12","category":"Other"}],"body":"Background: Since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to high transmissibility. We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is extending its range of transmission in all parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of associated disease. Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20033738","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Active or latent tuberculosis increases susceptibility to COVID-19 and disease severity","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shenyang","category":"Nation"},{"term":"IGRA+ve","category":"Nation"},{"term":"p=0.0047","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MTB","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Shenyang Chest Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COPD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"6.5+/-4.2","category":"Other"}],"body":"Importance: Risk factors associated with COVID-19, the viral pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019, require clarification so that medical resources can be prioritized for those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20033795","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak based on a realistic stochastic model","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global crisis due to its quick and wide spread over the world.

Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low.

To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Estimation of the final size of the second phase of the coronavirus epidemic by the logistic model","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the World.","category":"Organization"}],"body":"In the note, the logistic growth regression model is used for the estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest of the World.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.11.20024901","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical features and outcomes of 2019 novel coronavirus-infected patients with cardiac injury","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"n=7","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Aims To explore the epidemiological and clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV)-infected patients with cardiac injury .

Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Evaluating the effect of public health intervention on the global-wide spread trajectory of Covid-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"MAE","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Jun","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Aug","category":"Nation"}],"body":"As COVID-19 evolves rapidly, the issues the governments of affected countries facing are whether and when to take public health interventions and what levels of strictness of these interventions should be, as well as when the COVID-19 spread reaches the stopping point after interventions are taken.

The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.11.20034215","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Predicting the cumulative number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in China from early data","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China.

We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak.

COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant minformation about the virus leading to collatoral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The most sought after estimate is the projected number of people who may be contagious, but still be within the incubation period thus remaining asymptomatic and undetected. This parameter is useful for estimating the extent of outbreak among a population over time and what to expect. It is thus important for common sense decision making by governments, organizations, and even individuals to contain, prepare, prevent, react, and safeguard. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and a variable, called testing efficiency as variables. The Coronavirus outbreak in USA will be used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.11.20034512","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Environmental contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare premises: An urgent call for protection for healthcare workers","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"PPE","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Dacron","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Obstetric Isolation Ward","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Isolation Ward","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Main Outcomes","category":"Other"}],"body":"Importance A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Deep Learning-based Detection for COVID-19 from Chest CT using Weak Label","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"0.959 ROC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"GPU","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Weak Label","category":"Other"}],"body":"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 ℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Rational evaluation of various epidemic models based on the COVID-19 data of China","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Akaike","category":"Other"},{"term":"Gomertz","category":"Other"},{"term":"the SEIR-QD","category":"Other"},{"term":"SIR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SEIR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Hong Kong","category":"Location"},{"term":"H1N1","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Influenza B","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Health and Medical Research Fund","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Hong KongImpact","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Background: A range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and there have been major changes in behaviours of the general public. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 ± 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19.

We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%).

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.12.20034876","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Immune phenotyping based on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and IgG predicts disease severity and outcome for patients with COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"CLIA","category":"Other"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"NLRhiIgGhi","category":"Nation"},{"term":"NLRhiIgGlo","category":"Nation"},{"term":"NLRloIgGlo","category":"Nation"},{"term":"NLRhiIgGhi,","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Background: A recently emerging respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across the world. This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those who with low IgG levels (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p<0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlo phenotype (p<0.05). Recovery rate for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p=0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhi and NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.12.20035048","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Preliminary evaluation of voluntary event cancellation as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan as of 11 March, 2020","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"VEC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Background: To control COVID−19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 11 March.

Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively.

The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. Those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of the COVID-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically.

This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history.

Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.13.20035253","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.13.20035261","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Influence factors of death risk among COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China: a hospital-based case-cohort study","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Demographic","category":"Other"},{"term":"ALT","category":"Organization"},{"term":"TBIL","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Influence","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Background.

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators.

Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE. These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient β describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(α,t) with α = lnβ. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. In contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, Italian provinces on February 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rC/rE and corresponding decrease of β from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. Even higher reduction should take place in France, Germany and Spain for which β > 1.3 (as of March 10, 2020). Considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which rE decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. In such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine.","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.13.20035485","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Modelling the epidemic 2019-nCoV event in Italy: a preliminary note","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Susceptible (S","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Modelling","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"An analysis of the time evolution of the 2019-nCoV outbreak event in Italy is proposed and is based on the preliminary data at disposal (till March 11th, 2020) on one side, and on an epidemiological model recently used to describe the same epidemic event in the Wuhan region (February 2020) on the other side.

Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities. This is the first study for a major metropolitan center in the south hemisphere, and we believe it can provide policymakers with a prognosis of the burden of the pandemic not only in Brazil, but also in other tropical zones, allowing to estimate total cases, hospitalization, and deaths, in support to the management of the public health emergence caused by COVID-19.","time":1584403200000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.14.20035873","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Indications for healthcare surge capacity in European countries facing an exponential increase in COVID19 cases","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Spain","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Luxembourg","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Switzerland","category":"Nation"},{"term":"France","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Iceland","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Denmark","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Norway","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Sweden","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Slovenia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID19","category":"Nation"}],"body":"European healthcare systems face rapidly increasing pressure from COVID-19.

Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics.

The clinical spectrum of COVID−19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID−19 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID−19 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID−19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 − 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 − 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 − 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 − 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 − 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 − 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19.","time":1584316800000,"url":"10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19","source":"","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Demographic","category":"Other"}],"body":"Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. Interventions Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. Measurements and Main Results Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning. Conclusions The present study indicates that COVID 19–specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography scans.","time":1582848000000,"url":"10.1053/j.jvca.2020.02.039","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Persons Evaluated for 2019 Novel Coronavirus — United States, January 2020","source":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Genetic","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"CDC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Customs and Border Protection","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Emergency Operations Center","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PUI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in central China's Hubei Province.

METHODS: This study was conducted among Malaysian Umrah pilgrims in Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan. The questionnaire then underwent a series of validation process that included content, face validity and exploratory part. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was utilized for the validation of the knowledge domain. The attitude and practice were validated using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA). RESULTS: The validation process resulted in a questionnaire that comprised of four main sections: demography, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Following IRT analysis of the knowledge domain, all items analyzed were within the acceptable range of difficulty and discrimination. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) was 0.72 and 0.84 for attitude and practice domain respectively and Bartlett’s test of Sphericity for both domains were highly significant (P < 0.001). The factor analysis resulted in two factors with total of 12 items in attitude domain, and 2 factors with total of 13 items in the practice domain with satisfactory factor loading (> 0.3).

RESULTS: Twenty-six papers published from database inception to December 2018 were reviewed. A wide range of psychological and non-psychological outcomes were reported. There was a marked trend for isolated patients to exhibit higher levels of depression, the pooled standardised mean difference being 1.28 (95% CI 0.47 to 2.09) and anxiety 1.45 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34), although both had high levels of heterogeneity, and worse outcomes for a range of care-related factors but with significant variation.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. Methods In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. Results Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. Conclusions We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol.

Objective: Based on death notification data from Antananarivo, the capital city of Madagascar, this study assesses seasonal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality by age groups and evaluates how these patterns changed over the period 1976–2015. Methods: Monthly numbers of deaths by cause were obtained from death registers maintained by the Municipal Hygiene Office in charge of verifying deaths before the issuance of burial permits. Generalized Additive Mixed regression models (GAMM) were used to test for seasonality in mortality and its changes over the last four decades, controlling for long-term trends in mortality. Results: Among children, risks of dying were the highest during the hot and rainy season, but seasonality in child mortality has significantly declined since the mid-1970s, as a result of declines in the burden of infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies. In adults aged 60 and above, all-cause mortality rates are the highest in the dry and cold season, due to peaks in cardiovascular diseases, with little change over time. Overall, changes in the seasonality of all-cause mortality have been driven by shifts in the hierarchy of causes of death, while changes in the seasonality within broad categories of causes of death have been modest.

Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.","time":1581314400000,"url":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007587","urlToImage":""},{"title":"How to worry better","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"Rachel","category":"Other"}],"body":"As the coronavirus outbreak continues, the science of dealing with uncertainty can help us make better decisions, says Rachel McCloy","time":1584144000000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30546-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Early Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 28 Cases of Coronavirus Disease in South Korea","source":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Zhuhai","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Thailand","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Clinical","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"OBJECTIVES: The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of February 14(th), 2020. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease. METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team. RESULTS: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease.","time":1580536800000,"url":"10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.03","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Why the WHO won't use the p-word","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Debora","category":"Other"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"}],"body":"There are no criteria for a pandemic, but covid-19 looks like one, says Debora MacKenzie","time":1583539200000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30474-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The association between domestic train transportation and novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in China from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven correlational report","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101568","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Correction to Lancet Infect Dis 2019; 20: 275–76","source":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"Lancet Infect Dis 2019","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30071-2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), December 2019 to January 2020","source":"Euro Surveill","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"R(0","category":"Other"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.

The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1.

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10(2) to 10(3) genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 × 10(−5)). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [C(T)] values, <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (C(T) values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.","time":1577080800000,"url":"10.1128/JCM.00963-19","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A systematic risk-based strategy to select personal protective equipment for infectious diseases","source":"American Journal of Infection Control","keywords":[{"term":"PPE","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HCP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Conclusions Participation","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Staphylococcus","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Background Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (HCP) from infectious diseases. When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.","time":1580428800000,"url":"10.1016/j.ajic.2019.06.023","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: what we know","source":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020.

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th(,) 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.","time":1581400800000,"url":"10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in Qingdao, China","source":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Qingdao","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583798400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.004","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Mental health care for medical staff in China during the COVID-19 outbreak","source":"The Lancet Psychiatry","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30078-X","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19 in medical personnel: observation from Thailand","source":"Journal of Hospital Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Thailand","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.02.016","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Practical experiences and suggestions on the eagle-eyed observer, a novel promising role for controlling nosocomial infection of the COVID-19 outbreak","source":"Journal of Hospital Infection","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.02.020","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) antagonizes interferon-β production via blocking IPS-1 and RIG-I","source":"Virus Research","keywords":[{"term":"IPEC-J2","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SADS-CoV.","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SADS-CoV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Sendai","category":"Organization"},{"term":"IPS-1","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RIG-I.","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SASD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RIG","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a newly emerging enteric coronavirus, is considered to be associated with swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) which has caused significantly economic losses to the porcine industry.

We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Methods Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Results In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Conclusions Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.","time":1577750400000,"url":"10.1016/j.envint.2019.105150","urlToImage":""},{"title":"SARS to novel coronavirus – old lessons and new lessons","source":"Epidemiol Infect.; 148:e22","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China suggests that many of the lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic have been implemented and the response improved as a consequence.

The unprecedented measures implemented in China are a bold attempt to control the outbreak – we need to understand their effectiveness to balance costs and benefits for similar events in the future.","time":1577836800000,"url":"10.1017/S0950268820000254","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus infections reported by ProMED, February 2000–January 2020","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"the United Arab Emirates","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"North America","category":"Location"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract Introduction Sources describing the global burden of emerging diseases accurately are still limited. We reviewed coronavirus infections reported by ProMED and assessed the reliability of the data retrieved compared to published reports. We evaluated the effectiveness of ProMED as a source of epidemiological data on coronavirus. Methods Using the keyword “coronavirus” in the ProMED search engine, we reviewed all the information from the reports and collected data using a structured form, including year, country, gender, occupation, the number of infected individuals, and the number of fatal cases. Results We identified 109 entries reported between February 29, 2000 and January 22, 2020. A total of 966 cases were reported, with death reported in 188 cases, suggesting an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.5%. Of 70 cases for which the gender was reported, 47 (67.1%) were male. Most of the cases were reported from China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, with reports from other countries, including imported cases in Europe and North America. Conclusions Internet-based reporting systems such as ProMED are useful to gather information and synthesize knowledge on emerging infections.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Mucoviscidosis: fisiopatología, genética, aspectos clínicos y terapéuticos","source":"EMC - Pediatría","keywords":[{"term":"Resumen La","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CFTR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"En Francia","category":"Other"},{"term":"de Cl–","category":"Other"},{"term":"de la","category":"Other"},{"term":"Mucoviscidosis","category":"Other"}],"body":"Resumen La mucoviscidosis es la enfermedad autosómica recesiva grave más frecuente que afecta a la población caucásica. En Francia, por ejemplo, la incidencia es de un caso por cada 4.500 nacimientos. Esta enfermedad se debe a mutaciones en el gen CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, regulador de conductancia transmembrana de la fibrosis quística), situado en el brazo largo del cromosoma 7, que codifica una proteína transmembrana implicada en la regulación del transporte transepitelial de iones cloruro (Cl–). En Francia, la mutación más frecuente (alrededor del 80% de los casos) es la deleción del aminoácido 508 (fenilalanina), denominada F508del. La ausencia o la disfunción de la proteína CFTR provoca un defecto en el transporte de Cl– y un aumento de la reabsorción de sal y agua, en particular en el epitelio bronquial, lo que conlleva una reducción del líquido de la superficie bronquial. Esta exocrinopatía generalizada conduce a la producción de «moco viscoso» (de ahí el nombre de mucoviscidosis), que obstruye varios sitios en el cuerpo, en particular el sistema respiratorio, el tracto digestivo y sus anexos (páncreas, vías biliares e hígado). La detección neonatal se ha generalizado desde 2002. La prueba del sudor es la prueba complementaria de referencia, validada por la identificación de dos mutaciones patógenas, para la confirmación del diagnóstico. El tratamiento es multidisciplinario. Se basa ante todo en la kinesiterapia respiratoria diaria y el tratamiento de las sobreinfecciones broncopulmonares, así como en las recomendaciones nutricionales con el uso de extractos pancreáticos.

A deeper understanding of PEDV attenuation will aid in the rational design of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) using reverse genetics system. Our results showed that replacing the S gene from the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5 led to complete restoration of virulence of the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, with nearly identical viral shedding, diarrhea pattern, and mortality rate as the parental iPEDVPT-P5. In contrast, substitution of the S gene with that from the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96 resulted in partial attenuation of iPEDVPT-P5, exhibiting similar viral shedding and diarrhea patterns as the parental iPEDVPT-P96 with slightly severe histological lesions and higher mortality rate.

Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-α) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-α formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1β and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN-α formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs.

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","time":1581055200000,"url":"10.12688/f1000research.22211.2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Zhoushan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Sanger","category":"Other"},{"term":"SL-CoVZC45","category":"Organization"},{"term":"National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Shandong First Medical University","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Sarbecovirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"SARS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Summary Background In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Methods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

To this end there have been great efforts to train an additional 300 000 GPs by 2020. This paper examines the perspective of practitioners in Henan, China, regarding general practice. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach using focus group discussions (FGD), and structured questionnaires. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven FGDs and responses to 1887 questionnaires included medical students, primary care doctors and GP residents in Henan. RESULTS: The three surveyed medical groups have some awareness of the attributes of general practice (eg, comprehensiveness, first contact and coordination), but often misinterpret what being a GP entails. Five themes were identified through the FGDs and tested quantitatively for their prevalence with structured questionnaires. First, the GPs’ role as a comprehensive care provider was (mis)interpreted as an ‘all-round doctor’. Second, the GP’s responsibility as the first point of care was understood in two conflicting ways: private personal doctors of the rich and the powerful or village doctors for common people. Third, referral was understood as simply guiding patients to appropriate departments within the hospital while the gatekeeping role was interpreted to involve GPs being peoples’ health protectors rather than being also gatekeepers of specialty services. Traditional Chinese medicine now further complicates the understanding of GPs. And lastly, the GPs’ main responsibility was considered to be public health work. CONCLUSION: The misunderstandings of the roles and responsibilities of GPs render problematic the policy foundation of China’s GP-centred primary care system. Pursuing the quantity of GPs on its own is meaningless, since the number needed depends on the delineated role of GPs. Top priority is to establish clarity about the GP role, which requires reforming the health delivery system to address issues with fragmented care, strategically taking into account the development of GPs with work delegation and substitution and providing more clarity on the distinction between general practice and public health.","time":1580709600000,"url":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036240","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The neglected health of international migrant workers in the COVID-19 epidemic","source":"The Lancet Psychiatry","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30076-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Responding to health emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean region in times of conflict","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Eastern Mediterranean","category":"Location"},{"term":"the Eastern Mediterranean region","category":"Location"},{"term":"EMR","category":"Other"},{"term":"region,6","category":"Other"},{"term":"plan13","category":"Other"},{"term":"State","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Yemen","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Syria","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Afghanistan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pakistan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Iraq","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) is facing emergencies on a scale that is perhaps unprecedented in its history.

Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings.8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history.9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan.10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict,11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic.12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region,6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases.

Comparative metagenomic analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches. RESULTS: We reconstruct over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6 available NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the mappable fraction of metagenomic reads by 600%. These novel species highlight that almost 90% of the microbial diversity associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of this new catalog of taxa with the collection of over 150,000 genomes from human metagenomes points at a limited species-level overlap, with only 20% of microbial candidate species in NHPs also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly between NHPs and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living in captivity, suggesting that host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically related to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and Treponema, and could be the consequence of host-dependent evolutionary trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The newly reconstructed species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with NHPs, thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome and empowering in-depth human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies.","time":1577512800000,"url":"10.1186/s13059-019-1923-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"High expression of ACE2 receptor of 2019-nCoV on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa","source":"Int J Oral Sci","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Cap Analysis","category":"Other"}],"body":"It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the final infection. To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected.

Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.","time":1582524000000,"url":"10.1038/s41368-020-0074-x","urlToImage":""},{"title":"How bad will it get?","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"Debora","category":"Other"}],"body":"While the coronavirus death rate may be lower than some estimates, case numbers may be far higher, reports Debora MacKenzie","time":1581724800000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30278-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Tencent","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Beijing","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shanghai","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Guangzhou","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Shenzhen","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Chongqing","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hong Kong","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Jan 23–24","category":"Other"},{"term":"49–168","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Health and Medical Research Fund","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Summary Background Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304–130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks. Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate. To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has established standardised formats for classifying viruses. Under these rules, a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on phylogeny and taxonomy.4 Through DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering-based analyses,5 the newly emerged coronavirus was deemed not sufficiently novel but is a sister virus to SARS-CoV, the primary viral isolate defining the species. The SARS-CoV species includes viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV_PC4-227, and SARSr-CoV-btKY72. SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of this viral species. The use of SARS in naming SARS-CoV-2 does not derive from the name of the SARS disease but is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species. The use of SARS for viruses in this species mainly refers to their taxonomic relationship to the founding virus of this species, SARS-CoV. In other words, viruses in this species can be named SARS regardless of whether or not they cause SARS-like diseases.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30557-2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Identification of potential cross-protective epitope between a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus","source":"Journal of Genetics and Genomics","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1580342400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jgg.2020.01.003","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Virus Metagenomics in Farm Animals: A Systematic Review","source":"Viruses","keywords":[{"term":"Metagenomic","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pigs","category":"Other"},{"term":"Virus Metagenomics","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Farm Animals","category":"Organization"},{"term":"A Systematic Review","category":"Organization"}],"body":"A majority of emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin.

We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness.

CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.","time":1581400800000,"url":"10.1128/mBio.02764-19","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Community pharmacist in public health emergencies: Quick to action against the coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak","source":"Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Macau","category":"Nation"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"pharmacists’","category":"Organization"},{"term":"the International Pharmaceutical Federation","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Quick","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract The 2019-nCoV infection that is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in China in the end of December 2019 and declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020.

First, the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with RaTG13, human SARS (NC_004718.3), bat SARS (DQ022305.2), and human MERS (NC_019843.3) by calculating the similarity in a given sliding window (Figure 1A). The sliding window was set to 500 for ORF1ab and S, and to 50 for proteins E, M, and N considering their short length. SARS-CoV-2 were highly similar to RaTG13 isolated from bats, showing 96% identity based on the whole-nucleotide sequences and 83% based on the protein sequences, suggesting a bat zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2. ORF1a, and the head of S seemed to have diverged from other beta coronaviruses.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.027","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Open access epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak","source":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30119-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronaphobia: Fear and the 2019-nCoV outbreak","source":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","keywords":[{"term":"Coronaphobia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102196","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Quantitative computed tomography analysis for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019","source":"Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"GGO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Chi","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Purpose To examine the feasibility of using a computer tool for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, <1/3 involvement; 2, >1/3 and < 2/3 involvement; and 3, >2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P < 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = −0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (χ2 = 8.160, P = 0.004). Conclusions Our experiments demonstrated that the computer tool could reliably and accurately assess the severity and distribution of pneumonia on CT scans.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: Case of the Index Patient Who Caused Tertiary Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea: the Application of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia Monitored by Quantitative RT-PCR","source":"J Korean Med Sci","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582178400000,"url":"10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e88","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Do not violate the International Health Regulations during the COVID-19 outbreak","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30373-1","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?","source":"The Lancet Respiratory Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Xiaobo Yang","category":"Other"},{"term":"ACE","category":"Other"},{"term":"ACE2.5","category":"Other"},{"term":"study,3","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ARBs).4 Hypertension","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PubMed","category":"Nation"}],"body":"The most distinctive comorbidities of 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the study by Xiaobo Yang and colleagues1 were cerebrovascular diseases (22%) and diabetes (22%). Another study2 included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23·7%), diabetes mellitus (16·2%), coronary heart diseases (5·8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2·3%). In a third study,3 of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.4 The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs).4 Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2.5 ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. • View related content for this article If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism. We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30116-8","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Development of a one-run real-time PCR detection system for pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases","source":"J Vet Med Sci","keywords":[{"term":"Porcine","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Dempo","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Haemophilus","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Boldetella","category":"Other"},{"term":"Pasteurella","category":"Other"},{"term":"Streptococcus","category":"Other"},{"term":"Mycoplasma","category":"Other"}],"body":"The etiology of Porcine respiratory disease complex is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, and multiple infections increase the difficulty in identifying the causal pathogen.

To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 30.0). Together these findings indicate that the different types of midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry industries and geographic factors.","time":1579586400000,"url":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1007857","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Corona Virus International Public Health Emergencies: Implications for Radiology Management","source":"Academic Radiology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Implications for Radiology Management","category":"Organization"}],"body":"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread internationally.

SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. Methods We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. Findings We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R t) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R t, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learning is largely undisrupted. Although these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health.3 , 4 Evidence suggests that when children are out of school (eg, weekends and summer holidays), they are physically less active, have much longer screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less favourable diets, resulting in weight gain and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness.3 , 5 Such negative effects on health are likely to be much worse when children are confined to their homes without outdoor activities and interaction with same aged friends during the outbreak.","time":1583280000000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30547-X","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Comparison of the performance of ITS1 and ITS2 as barcodes in amplicon-based sequencing of bioaerosols","source":"PeerJ","keywords":[{"term":"High-Throughput Sequencing","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HTS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Comparison","category":"Other"}],"body":"This paper presents the performance of two eukaryotic genomic ribosomal regions, ITS1 and ITS2, in describing fungal diversity in aerosol samples using amplicon-based High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Composting sites, biomethanization facilities, and dairy farms, all affected by the presence of fungi, were visited to collect air samples. The amplicon-based HTS approach is a target enrichment method that relies on the amplification of a specific target using particular primers before sequencing. Thus, the results are highly dependent on the quality of amplification. For this reason, the authors of this paper used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare its outcome with the amplicon-based method. Indeed, shotgun metagenomic does not rely on any amplification prior to sequencing, because all genes are sequenced without a specific target. In addition, culture methods were added to the analyses in biomethanization and dairy farms samples to validate their contribution to fungal diversity of aerosols. The results obtained are unequivocal towards ITS1 outperformance to ITS2 in terms of richness, and taxonomic coverage. The differential abundance analysis did demonstrate that some taxa were exclusively detected only by ITS2, and vice-versa for ITS1. However, the shotgun metagenomic approach showed a taxonomic profile more resembling to ITS1 than ITS2. Based on these results, neither of the barcodes evaluated is perfect in terms of distinguishing all species. Using both barcodes offers a broader view of the fungal aerosol population. However, with the actual knowledge, the authors strongly recommend using ITS1 as a universal fungal barcode for quick general analyses of diversity and when limited financial resources are available, primarily due its ability to capture taxonomic profiles similar to those obtained using the shotgun metagenomic. The culture comparison with amplicon-based sequencing showed the complementarity of both approaches in describing the most abundant taxa.","time":1581919200000,"url":"10.7717/peerj.8523","urlToImage":""},{"title":"2019-novel coronavirus outbreak: A new challenge","source":"Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance","keywords":[{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PubMed","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Cochrane","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COPD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Multiple","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Cardiovascular","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Objectives Following the public health emergency declared by the World Health Organization and the recent outbreak by 2019-nCoV in China and through other 29 countries, we aimed to summarize the clinical aspects of novel beta-coronavirus infection and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antibiotic treatment.

Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV, at least in the early phases of disease. Conclusions The new 2019-nCoV epidemics is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory comorbidities.","time":1583539200000,"url":"10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.021","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak","source":"Journal of Autoimmunity","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1—a woman in her 60s—returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. Methods All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. Findings By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates. METHODS: The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death. However, vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed.","time":1580515200000,"url":"10.21037/tp.2020.02.06","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Did the hesitancy in declaring COVID-19 a pandemic reflect a need to redefine the term?","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1584057600000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30630-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The first 2019 novel coronavirus case in Nepal","source":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"Nepal","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30067-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR","source":"Euro Surveill","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"European Union","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur.

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.

As a result, sequence similarity of paralogous genes is significantly higher than expected from their evolutionary distance. Gene conversion, a “copy paste” DNA repair mechanism that transfers sequences from one gene to another and homologous recombination are drivers of concerted evolution. Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire CEA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.","time":1582610400000,"url":"10.1038/s41598-020-60425-4","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19): The first two patients in the UK with person to person transmission","source":"Journal of Infection","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1582848000000,"url":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.020","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Quick crossword #53","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"Richard SmythQuick","category":"Other"}],"body":"Set by Richard Smyth","time":1584144000000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30559-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Summary Background Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020. Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days.

The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade’s first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’ on January 30(th), 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.","time":1581120000000,"url":"10.1080/01652176.2020.1727993","urlToImage":""},{"title":"China uses mass surveillance tech to fight spread of coronavirus","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582329600000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30378-X","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Identifying factors and target preventive therapies for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome sucsibtable patients","source":"Saudi Pharm J","keywords":[{"term":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"METHOD","category":"Other"},{"term":"Percentages","category":"Other"},{"term":"Cov","category":"Other"},{"term":"Medication","category":"Organization"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus. We also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission. METHOD: We included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected cases. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 16,189 suspected cases were identified, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.06; 95% CI [1.02–1.098], P-value = 0.004), male gender (AOR = 1.617; 95% CI [1.365–1.77], P-value < 0.001) and diabetes (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.346–1.848], P-value = 0.002. There was no significant association with the other comorbidities. Medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-Cov infection is more common in male, advanced age and diabetes. No medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. This is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient population.","time":1581055200000,"url":"10.1016/j.jsps.2019.11.016","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Covid-19 goes global","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"Italy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Debora","category":"Other"}],"body":"Our chance to limit international outbreaks may be over as the virus spreads in Italy and the Middle East, reports Debora MacKenzie","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30424-3","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Insights into the cross-species evolution of 2019 novel coronavirus","source":"Journal of Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"North America","category":"Location"},{"term":"Oceania","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Recent study reported in this journal that the threats of continuous evolution and dissemination of 2019 human coronaviruses.1 Since its emergence in December 2019, a “seventh” member of the family of 2019 human coronavirus named “SARS-CoV-2” was responsible for an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.2 As of February 23, 2020, China had reported more than 77,042 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, with 2,445 fatalities and counting (http://www.nhc.gov.cn).

It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.","time":1577167200000,"url":"10.1016/j.celrep.2019.11.107","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID 19: Will the 2020 Hajj pilgrimage and Tokyo Olympic Games be cancelled?","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Hajj","category":"Other"}],"body":"","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101622","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Therapeutic and triage strategies for 2019 novel coronavirus disease in fever clinics","source":"The Lancet Respiratory Medicine","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30071-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A case of COVID-19 and pneumonia returning from Macau in Taiwan: Clinical course and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG dynamic","source":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Macau","category":"Nation"},{"term":"RT-PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Taiwan","category":"Location"}],"body":"Abstract A 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 2-day fever and cough at seven days after returning from Macau.

Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single species’ ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 species’ ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s.

Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. Findings Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.

Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020.

Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.

Upon identifying the index case, National Emergency Operations Centres were immediately activated to trace his contacts. By March 9, 2020, 27 suspected cases had been identified across five states (Edo, Lagos, Ogun, Federal Capital Territory, and Kano), of which two were confirmed to be positive (ie, the index case and a contact), with no deaths.1 216 contacts were linked to the index case, 136 of whom are being followed up. Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nigeria—Lagos and Rivers State—of whom eight died of Ebola.2 The dense population of Lagos, its overstrained infrastructure, and the fact that it is a major regional transit hub for air, land, and sea transport created the perfect conditions for the spread of Ebola. Nevertheless, Nigeria's aggressive and coordinated response successfully controlled the Ebola epidemic.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30101-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical and CT imaging features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","source":"Journal of Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Tang JW","category":"Other"},{"term":"P1-P5","category":"Other"},{"term":"Common","category":"Other"},{"term":"Journal","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Tang JW, et al. and colleagues have written to this Journal describing the emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 We have had an opportunity to examine in detail the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in cases with microbiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, to familiarize radiologists and clinicians with the imaging manifestations of this new outbreak.

Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America. We demonstrate marked variation in viral communities that was not consistently predicted by a null model of declining community similarity with increasing spatial or genetic distances separating populations. We also find no evidence that larger bat colonies host greater viral diversity. Instead, viral diversity follows an elevational gradient, is enriched by juvenile‐biased age structure, and declines with local anthropogenic food resources as measured by livestock density. Our results establish the value of linking the modern influx of metagenomic sequence data with comparative ecology, reveal that snapshot views of viral diversity are unlikely to be representative at the species level, and affirm existing ecological theories that link host ecology not only to single pathogen dynamics but also to viral communities.","time":1579759200000,"url":"10.1111/mec.15250","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A Tale of Two Viruses: The Distinct Spike Glycoproteins of Feline Coronaviruses","source":"Viruses","keywords":[{"term":"FCoV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FIP","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a complex viral agent that causes a variety of clinical manifestations in cats, commonly known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.","time":1585699200000,"url":"10.1016/j.bios.2020.112041","urlToImage":""},{"title":"2019-nCoV: Polite with children!","source":"Pediatr Rep","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"A novel epidemic is challenging the global health care system.

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.

We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012–2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015–2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R(0)) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1≤R(0)≤2,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible.

It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compound’s observed cytotoxicity in these cell lines.","time":1580104800000,"url":"10.1128/AAC.01719-19","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Jinyintan Hospital","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SOFA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"National Science Grant for","category":"Organization"},{"term":"National Key Research and Development Program","category":"Organization"},{"term":"The Beijing Science and Technology Project","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Demographic","category":"Other"},{"term":"p<0·0001","category":"Other"}],"body":"Summary Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (−) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5′-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (−). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5′-UTR, CR-31-B (−) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5′-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104706","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Pregnancy: What obstetricians need to know","source":"American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pregnancy","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Limited","category":"Organization"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1·3 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted,1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and external expert teams to Hubei province. The emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia has parallels with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was caused by another coronavirus that killed 349 of 5327 patients with confirmed infection in China.3 Although the diseases have different clinical presentations, the infectious cause, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, and insufficient preparedness of health authorities to address the outbreaks are similar. So far, mental health care for the patients and health professionals directly affected by the 2019-nCoV epidemic has been under-addressed, although the National Health Commission of China released the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions for the 2019-nCoV pneumonia on Jan 26, 2020. This notification contained a reference to mental health problems and interventions that occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak, and mentioned that mental health care should be provided for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonitis, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, patients in fever clinics, families and friends of affected people, health professionals caring for infected patients, and the public who are in need. To date, epidemiological data on the mental health problems and psychiatric morbidity of those suspected or diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV and their treating health professionals have not been available; therefore how best to respond to challenges during the outbreak is unknown. The observations of mental health consequences and measures taken during the 2003 SARS outbreak could help inform health authorities and the public to provide mental health interventions to those who are in need.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8","urlToImage":""},{"title":"First imported case of 2019 novel coronavirus in Canada, presenting as mild pneumonia","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Canada","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30370-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and risk factors for death: Retrospective analysis of all laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO from 2012 to 2 June 2018","source":"Journal of Infection and Public Health","keywords":[{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract Background Approximately half of the reported laboratory-confirmed infections of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have occurred in healthcare settings, and healthcare workers constitute over one third of all secondary infections. This study aimed to describe secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. Results Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001), non-nationals (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic (P < 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P < 0.001). Year of infection (2013–2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases. Conclusion Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare-associated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jiph.2019.04.011","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019:a retrospective cohort study","source":"Journal of Infection","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"LPV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"LPV/","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Arbidol","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Invasive","category":"Other"}],"body":"Abstract Background Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China.

Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly. MAIN BODY: Participants reported, through discussions and a post-game survey, that they felt the game was reflective of real-world decision-making and priority-setting challenges during a crisis. They reflected on the challenges that emerge around global health co-operation and outbreak preparedness, particularly noting the importance of learning to work with private actors. While participants only sporadically applied gender-based analysis or considered the social determinants of health during the game, post-game discussions led to reflection on the ways in which equity concerns are put aside during a crisis scenario and on why this happens, offering critical learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Matrix games provide opportunities for policy-makers and health professionals to experience the challenges of global health co-operation, test ideas and explore how biases, such as those around gender, influence policy-making and implementation. Due to their flexibility, adaptability and accessibility, serious games offer a potentially powerful learning tool for global health policy-makers and practitioners.","time":1583798400000,"url":"10.1186/s12992-020-00547-6","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in a Hemodialysis Patient","source":"Kidney Medicine","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Limited","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Pneumonia","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infective disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2).

In this crisis, what role can companies play? Public and private companies must continue to produce or provide their services, but with consideration of the health context. Many companies are involved with the COVID-19 outbreak because they are established in or work with China (client or supplier), and most have already activated their business continuity planning or equivalent. During an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19, most large companies around the world have a major part to play, especially in terms of preparedness and emergency response. Indeed, companies should be integrated into the governmental health contingency plan developed in many countries, and by WHO and the International Labor Organization.

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling.

A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%–99.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) are crucial immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, or IgM. Importantly, CHN-JS-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcRn, pIgR, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)in the intestinal mucosa. Note that the level of FcRn mRNA in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pIgR and NF-κB. At the same time, the expressions of FcRn, pIgR, and NF-κB mRNA are also positively correlated in infected piglets.

By 17 February 2020, Singapore recorded the highest number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China with several clusters of local transmission. All healthcare institutions adopted a common strategy of containment, with isolation of all suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in negative-pressure rooms. We were fortunate that most ICU beds were single rooms—this infrastructure was put in place following the outbreak of SARS in 2003. We realized preparing ICUs for patients with COVID-19 had numerous other requirements. First, infection control not only involved strict adherence to personal protective equipment for the individual, but also involved changes in group dynamics. We organized our ICU to mitigate the effects of any infected staff by avoiding potential spread between teams (see Table 1). Related to infection control, the medical ICU was given the task to cohort suspect or confirmed cases, including with peri- and post-partum care of pregnant women.

ENDU-2 expression is induced by nucleotide imbalance and genotoxic stress, and ENDU-2 exerts its function in the intestine, mostly by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 through repressing the PKA pathway and histone deacetylase HDA-1.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","time":1582848000000,"url":"10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Prediction of novel mouse TLR9 agonists using a random forest approach","source":"BMC Mol Cell Biol","keywords":[{"term":"ODN","category":"Organization"},{"term":"CpG","category":"Organization"},{"term":"mTLR9","category":"Organization"},{"term":"‘CC’","category":"Organization"},{"term":"mTLR9 ODN","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Inertia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"0.61","category":"Nation"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptor 9 is a key innate immune receptor involved in detecting infectious diseases and cancer. TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structure-based virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling. RESULTS: Using in-house experimental TLR9 activity data we found that random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms for our dataset for TLR9 activity prediction. Therefore, we developed a cross-validated ensemble classifier of 20 random forest models. The average Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced accuracy of our ensemble classifier in test samples was 0.61 and 80.0%, respectively, with the maximum balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 87.0% and 0.75, respectively. We confirmed common sequence motifs including ‘CC’, ‘GG’,‘AG’, ‘CCCG’ and ‘CGGC’ were overrepresented in mTLR9 agonists. Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity. CONCLUSION: We combined repeated random down-sampling with random forest to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieved promising results. Overall, we showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed other machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, shrinkage discriminant analysis, gradient boosting machine and neural networks. Due to its predictive performance and simplicity, the random forest technique is a useful method for prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists.","time":1576821600000,"url":"10.1186/s12860-019-0241-0","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Atypical lung feature on chest CT in a lung adenocarcinoma cancer patient infected with COVID-19","source":"Annals of Oncology","keywords":[],"body":"","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Lessons learned from the 2019-nCoV epidemic on prevention of future infectious diseases","source":"Microbes and Infection","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"United States","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"}],"body":"Abstract Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected.

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD.

However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals.

Several studies have been done to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date. METHODS: In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. RESULTS: We estimated that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS: Our early estimates suggest that the CFR of COVID-19 is lower than the previous coronavirus epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","time":1580515200000,"url":"10.21037/atm.2020.02.66","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Tuberculosis and novel Wuhan coronavirus infection: Pathological interrelationship","source":"Indian Journal of Tuberculosis","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"","time":1582675200000,"url":"10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.02.004","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Initiation of a new infection control system for the COVID-19 outbreak","source":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582070400000,"url":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30110-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Imported Wuhan Coronavirus Infection: Is there any Correlation with Number of Immigrants from Endemic Area and Period after the First Outbreak?","source":"Int J Prev Med","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"the First Outbreak","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1582243200000,"url":"10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_41_20","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a question needing an answer","source":"Journal of Hospital Infection","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Intensive care unit","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PPE","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Northern Italy","category":"Location"},{"term":"Kim","category":"Other"},{"term":"Zou","category":"Other"}],"body":"In December 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the Chinese province of Hubei.[1] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition, defined coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[2] The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of February.[3] After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days, with 80% of those infected developing a mild disease, 15% a severe disease and 5% will require support in intensive care unit (ICU).[4] Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28.[4,5] SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist, thus everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The impact of repeated vaccination using 10-year vaccination history on protection against influenza in older adults: a test-negative design study across the 2010/11 to 2015/16 influenza seasons in Ontario, Canada","source":"Euro Surveill","keywords":[{"term":"Ontario","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Canada","category":"Nation"},{"term":"9–10","category":"Nation"},{"term":"4–6","category":"Organization"}],"body":"INTRODUCTION: Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for older adults, but evidence regarding the impact of repeated vaccination has been inconclusive. AIM: We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season VE among older adults. METHODS: We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history. RESULTS: We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%). Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than patients who had received 1–3 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4–6 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%), 7–8 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9–10 (7%; 95%CI: −4 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test p = 0.001). All estimates were higher after correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status. For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received previously. CONCLUSIONS: Although VE appeared to decrease with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations, current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless of the number of vaccinations received over the previous 10 influenza seasons.","time":1578549600000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.1.1900245","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effectiveness for the Response to COVID-19: The MERS Outbreak Containment Procedures","source":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","keywords":[{"term":"Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RT) PCR","category":"Organization"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Kim","category":"Other"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"In the current issue of Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, 3 studies are presented dealing with COVID-19.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues—liver, lung, and kidney—in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.","time":1579586400000,"url":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1008537","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Imported into Korea from Wuhan, China: Implication for Infection Prevention and Control Measures","source":"J Korean Med Sci","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pneumonia Imported","category":"Other"},{"term":"Implication for Infection Prevention and Control Measures","category":"Organization"}],"body":"In December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China.

This study investigated the safety of a proprietary extract of C. sativa, consisting of 9% hemp extract (of which 6.27% is CBD) and 91% olive oil. The mutagenic potential of the hemp extract was evaluated with the AMES assay inclusive of a hepatic drug metabolizing mix (S9) rich in CYP enzymes. The test article did not elicit evidence of bacterial mutagenicity. GLP compliant 14-day and a 90-day toxicity study were conducted. Olive oil was used as a control. The 90-day study had a 28-day recovery period. Treatments for the 14-day non-recovery range-finding study were 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg test article/kg body weight (bw)/day for 14 days. There was a non-statistically significant (p > 0.05) decrease in body weights for the male and female rats receiving the test article. Hypoactivity, hyperactivity, reduced food consumption and piloerection were observed in the rats receiving 4000 mg test article/kg bw. Histopathology showed an increase in the size of liver cells (hypertrophy) around the central vein (centrilobular) in Groups 3 (3/10) and 4 (5/10) that correlated with increased liver weights. In the 90-day study, 8 groups of rats were dosed with 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg test article/kg bw/day. Groups 5 to 8 had a 28-day recovery. There were no test article-linked changes in clinical observations, physical examinations, Functional Observation Battery, ophthalmology, Motor Activity Assessment, hematology, clinical chemistries and macropathology (all groups). With the exception of the liver and adrenal gland, no test article-linked pathology was observed. For all rats receiving the test article, histopathology showed hypertrophy of liver cells around the central vein. The increase of liver weight is most likely caused by hypertrophy due to up-regulation of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. The hepatocellular hypertrophy was completely reversed in 28 days and was not considered to be an adverse effect. Vacuolization of the adrenal zona fasciculata was observed in the control and 800 mg test article/kg bw groups. The vacuolization of the zona fasciculata was of the same incidence and severity in treatment and control male rats and correlated with an increased in the weights of the adrenal glands. In addition, a statistically significant increase (p<0.05) in adrenal-to-body weight ratios was observed for females receiving 800 mg test article/kg bw. This increase in adrenal-to-body weight ratio did not correlate with any of the pathology findings. The NOAEL for the test article is 800 mg/kg bw/day for female and 400 mg/kg bw/day for male Sprague Dawley rats.","time":1582178400000,"url":"10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.02.014","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Maps, masks and media – Traveller and practitioner resources for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory virus","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582934400000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101574","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Proposed protocol to keep COVID-19 out of hospitals","source":"Canadian Medical Association Journal","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583625600000,"url":"10.1503/cmaj.1095852","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Geographical tracking and mapping of coronavirus disease COVID-19/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic and associated events around the world: how 21st century GIS technologies are supporting the global fight against outbreaks and epidemics","source":"Int J Health Geogr","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"GIS","category":"Nation"},{"term":"GIS","category":"Organization"}],"body":"In December 2019, a new virus (initially called ‘Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV’ and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China’s massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing self-reported compliance and its behavioural correlates. SETTING: Internships of medical students in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 322 medical students of the Erasmus Medical Center were recruited over a period of 12 months during the Public Health internship, which is the final compulsory internship after an 18-month rotation schedule in all major specialities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural factors influencing compliance to hand hygiene guidelines were measured by means of a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Social Ecological Models. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the effect of including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, knowledge, risk perception and habit on hand hygiene compliance. RESULTS: We included 313 students in the analysis (response rate 97%). The behavioural model explained 40% of the variance in self-reported compliance (adjusted R(2)=0.40). Hand hygiene compliance was strongly influenced by attitudes (perceived outcomes of preventive actions), self-efficacy (perception of the ability to perform hand hygiene at the clinical ward) and habit, but was not associated with knowledge and risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting medical students’ behaviour should focus on the empowerment of these juniors and provide them with evidence on the health benefits of prevention, rather than increasing their factual knowledge of procedures. Clinical teaching environments could help them form good patient safety habits during this vital phase of their career.","time":1581487200000,"url":"10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029484","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Comorbidities and multi-organ injuries in the treatment of COVID-19","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus","category":"Organization"},{"term":"WHO","category":"Organization"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"C.

More attention should be paid to comorbidities in the treatment of COVID-19. In the literature, COVID-19 is characterised by the symptoms of viral pneumonia such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and lymphopenia. Many of the older patients who become severely ill have evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, or malignant tumours.3, 4, 5 These patients often die of their original comorbidities; we therefore need to accurately evaluate all original comorbidities of individuals with COVID-19. In addition to the risk of group transmission of an infectious disease, we should pay full attention to the treatment of the original comorbidities of the individual while treating pneumonia, especially in older patients with serious comorbid conditions. Not only capable of causing pneumonia, COVID-19 may also cause damage to other organs such as the heart, the liver, and the kidneys, as well as to organ systems such as the blood and the immune system.3, 4, 5 Patients eventually die of multiple organ failure, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, and renal failure.5, 6 We should therefore pay attention to potential multi-organ injuries and the protection and prevention thereof in the treatment of COVID-19. • View related content for this article We took over a ward for the centralised treatment of severely ill patients in Wuhan Tongji Hospital. 60 patients were classified into three types during their treatment. 13 [22%] of 60 patients mainly had pneumonia and were classified as type A. Basic treatments were provided, such as antivirals, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and glucocorticoids. 33 (55%) of 60 patients were type B, with disease that manifested with different degrees of pneumonia, accompanied by serious comorbidities. For patients classified as type B, we continued to monitor the changes of comorbidities while managing the pneumonia, carrying out individual evaluations and developing specific treatment plans, including antihypertensives, hypoglycaemic therapy, and continuous renal replacement therapy. 14 (23%) of 60 patients were critically ill and were classified as type C. Patients classified as type C had disease that was considered to have developed from the aggravation of disease seen either in type A or type B, when early therapeutic effects for type A disease were unsatisfactory (resulting in multiple organ injuries), or when disease associated with type B became aggravated and the patient's condition deteriorated from their original comorbidities (leading to multiple organ failure). Attention should be paid to organ function in these critically ill patients and necessary protective measures, including mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, antivirals, symptomatic treatments, and anti-shock therapy. We believe that the classification of COVID-19 in severe patients could help in individual evaluation of the disease and would provide effective triage for the treatment and management of individual patients. We declare no competing interests.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30558-4","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Computers and viral diseases.

The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent.

However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002–03, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1–1/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2·5 in the early stages of the epidemic,2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses?","source":"Microbes and Infection","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Hubei","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"ADE","category":"Organization"}],"body":"Abstract One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world.

ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths.

Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of ~10(5) focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD(50) < 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.","time":1577426400000,"url":"10.1038/s41598-019-56291-4","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Le nouveau Coronavirus Covid-19 : quels risques ophtalmiques ?","source":"Journal Français d'Ophtalmologie","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1583712000000,"url":"10.1016/j.jfo.2020.02.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"COVID-19: Yet Another Coronavirus Challenge in Transplantation","source":"The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation","keywords":[{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"}],"body":"","time":1584144000000,"url":"10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.007","urlToImage":""},{"title":"A new pandemic out of China: the Wuhan 2019-nCoV coronavirus syndrome","source":"Health Policy and Technology","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Recomendaciones sobre el manejo clínico de la infección por el «nuevo coronavirus» SARS-CoV2.

However, in-depth analysis of these data show clear disparities in mortality rates between Wuhan (>3%), different regions of Hubei (about 2·9% on average), and across the other provinces of China (about 0·7% on average). We postulate that this is likely to be related to the rapid escalation in the number of infections around the epicentre of the outbreak, which has resulted in an insufficiency of health-care resources, thereby negatively affecting patient outcomes in Hubei, while this has not yet been the situation for the other parts of China (figure A, B). If we assume that average levels of health care are similar throughout China, higher numbers of infections in a given population can be considered an indirect indicator of a heavier health-care burden.

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.","time":1578722400000,"url":"10.3390/cells9010187","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Outbreak of novel Corona virus (2019-nCoV); implications for travelers to Pakistan","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Corona","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Pakistan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1580774400000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101571","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Minimise nosocomial spread of 2019-nCoV when treating acute respiratory failure","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30359-7","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Effect of acute respiratory infections in infancy on pulmonary function test at 3 years of age: a prospective birth cohort study","source":"BMJ Open Respir Res","keywords":[{"term":"ARI","category":"Organization"},{"term":"RTC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FVC","category":"Organization"},{"term":"FEV(1.0","category":"Other"},{"term":"FEV(0.5","category":"Other"}],"body":"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in infancy may have a long-term impact on the developing respiratory system. We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25–75)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy.

Although the disease is now better contained in China, 32 702 cases remain as of March 2, 2020. 10 566 cases and 166 deaths outside of China had been reported as of March 3 (WHO situation report 43), which is a large increase from the 2918 cases and 44 deaths reported on Feb 26 (WHO situation report 37). Rapid progress has been made with diagnostic reagents (eg, nucleic acid and IgM or IgG detection, or both), drug repurposing (eg, remdesivir and chloroquine), and vaccine production. Studies on the biology of viral infection and clinical management of the disease have also been published, some of which have demonstrated that differences in COVID-19 disease prevalence and severity are associated with sex, and smoking is related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), so that might also be a factor. One study (preprint),1 using single-cell sequencing, found that expression of ACE2 was more predominant in Asian men, which might be the reason for the higher prevalence of COVID-19 in this subgroup of patients than in women and patients of other ethnicities. One study of 140 patients with COVID-19 in China,2 found the sex distribution equal; whereas, in a study of critically ill patients,3 more men were affected (67%) than women. In a latest report4 of 1099 patients with COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces in China, 58% of the patients were men. Taken together, these data seem to indicate that there might be a sex predisposition to COVID-19, with men more prone to being affected. This sex predisposition might be associated with the much higher smoking rate in men than in women in China (288 million men vs 12·6 million women were smokers in 2018). Of note, one study (preprint)5 found that although ACE2 expression was not significantly different between Asian and white people, men and women, or subgroups aged older and younger than 60 years, it was significantly higher in current smokers of Asian ethnicity than Asian non-smokers; although no difference was found between smokers and non-smokers who were white. Nonetheless, the current literature does not support smoking as a predisposing factor in men or any subgroup for infection with SARS-CoV-2. In the study by Zhang and colleagues,2 only 1·4% of patients were current smokers, although this number was much higher at 12·6% in the study by Guan and colleagues.4 The relatively small proportion of current smokers in each of these two studies compared with the proportion of male smokers in China (50·5%) are unlikely to be associated with incidence or severity of COVID-19. A trend towards an association was seen between smoking and severity of COVID-19 in the study by Zhang and colleagues2 (11·8% of smokers had non-severe disease vs 16·9% of smokers with severe disease), but it was not significant. Without strong evidence of an association between smoking and prevalence or severity of COVID-19 in Asian men compared with other subgroups, no firm conclusions can be drawn. With more cases being examined from different ethnic and genetic backgrounds worldwide, ACE2 expression variation can be better analysed and compared to establish whether it contributes to susceptibility to COVID-19 across the different subgroups.","time":1583884800000,"url":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30117-X","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Vaccines and Therapeutics Against Hantaviruses","source":"Front Microbiol","keywords":[{"term":"Americas","category":"Location"},{"term":"HFRS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HCPS","category":"Organization"},{"term":"HTNV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SEOV,","category":"Organization"},{"term":"PUUV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ANDV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"SNV","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Eurasia","category":"Nation"},{"term":"South Korea","category":"Nation"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SEOV","category":"Other"}],"body":"Hantaviruses (HVs) are rodent-transmitted viruses that can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia.

The presence of lymphopenia as a signature of severe COVID-19 was confirmed by Wang D et al, who, in their study published in JAMA, reported that ICU patients suffering this infection had a median lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm,3 with non survivors exhibiting persistent lymphopenia.4 ICU patients present also with high levels of plasma cytokines.2 The existence of hyper-cytokinemia in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia could indicate a poor control of the pathogen, as showed in severe patients infected with the 2009 Pandemic Influenza virus. Interestingly, hypercytokinemia and lymphopenia were also evident in critical patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to the Coronavirus emerged in 2003 (SARS-CoV).5,6 These features (lymphopenia + hypercytokinemia) fit the characteristics of a particular immunological phenotype of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), lymphopenic CAP (L-CAP), which, as we recently demonstrated in an article published in the Journal of Infection, is associated with increased severity, mortality and a dysregulated immunological response.7 In their works, Yang X et al and Chen N et al propose a direct cytotoxic action of the virus to explain the low lymphocyte counts observed in the severe cases of COVID-19.3,8 But, in our opinion, host factors could also contribute to induce lymphopenia in these cases. Compared with those patients not requiring intensive care, COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU are older and are more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.4 Aging and chronic diseases induce chronic endothelial dysfunction. As we recently reviewed in J Clin Med, endothelial dysfunction induces disassembly of intercellular junctions, endothelial cell death and blood-tissue barrier disruption, along with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, which could contribute to explain the lymphopenia observed in severe COVID-19 patients.9 Recent findings from our group have evidenced the interconnection between lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAP and organ failure.10 Endothelial dysfunction induces also increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, glycocalyx degradation and shedding along with a pro-coagulant and anti-fibrinolytic state.9 In aged individuals with chronic diseases, these features could represent predisposing factors for presenting a severe respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.029","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Cardiac troponin I in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Evidence from a meta-analysis","source":"Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583798400000,"url":"10.1016/j.pcad.2020.03.001","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Association between 2019-nCoV transmission and N95 respirator use","source":"Journal of Hospital Infection","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1583193600000,"url":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.02.021","urlToImage":""},{"title":"What goes on board aircraft?

John Zarocostas reports from WHO is leading the effort to slow the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. But a global epidemic of misinformation—spreading rapidly through social media platforms and other outlets—poses a serious problem for public health. “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic”, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on Feb 15. Immediately after COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO's risk communication team launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), with the aim of using a series of amplifiers to share tailored information with specific target groups. Sylvie Briand, director of Infectious Hazards Management at WHO's Health Emergencies Programme and architect of WHO's strategy to counter the infodemic risk, told The Lancet, “We know that every outbreak will be accompanied by a kind of tsunami of information, but also within this information you always have misinformation, rumours, etc. We know that even in the Middle Ages there was this phenomenon”. “But the difference now with social media is that this phenomenon is amplified, it goes faster and further, like the viruses that travel with people and go faster and further. So it is a new challenge, and the challenge is the [timing] because you need to be faster if you want to fill the void…What is at stake during an outbreak is making sure people will do the right thing to control the disease or to mitigate its impact. So it is not only information to make sure people are informed; it is also making sure people are informed to act appropriately.” About 20 staff and some consultants are involved in WHO's communications teams globally, at any given time. This includes social media personnel at each of WHO's six regional offices, risk communications consultants, and WHO communications officers.","time":1583452800000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30461-X","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Analysis of preferred codon usage in the coronavirus N genes and their implications for genome evolution and vaccine design","source":"Journal of Virological Methods","keywords":[{"term":"GC%","category":"Nation"},{"term":"GC3s","category":"Nation"},{"term":"pedCoV","category":"Nation"},{"term":"MERS-CoV","category":"Virus"}],"body":"Abstract The nucleocapsid (N) protein of a coronavirus plays a crucial role in virus assembly and in its RNA transcription. It is important to characterize a virus at the nucleotide level to discover the virus’s genomic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins. This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3rd position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively. These data implied a high rate of evolution of the CoV genomes and a strong influence of mutation on evolutionary selection in the CoV N genes. This type of genetic analysis would be useful for evaluating a virus’s host adaptation, evolution and is thus of value to vaccine design strategies.","time":1585612800000,"url":"10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113806","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Clinical characteristics of laboratory confirmed positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China: A retrospective single center analysis","source":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","keywords":[{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101606","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China","source":"Cell Host & Microbe","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Coronavirus","category":"Virus"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"An in-depth annotation of the newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genome has revealed differences between 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses.

In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had β-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] ≤ 8–18), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9–71, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR ≤ 8–38, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor ≥ 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN ≥ 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.","time":1583042400000,"url":"10.4269/ajtmh.19-0502","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The cancellation of mass gatherings (MGs)?

The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.","time":1583366400000,"url":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30152-3","urlToImage":""},{"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from a one health perspective","source":"One Health","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"}],"body":"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus candidate recently detected in China that is now reported in people on inhabited continents.

The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant or Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection.

In spite of a high mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, no antiviral drugs or licensed vaccine is available in India. HEV-protease is a pivotal enzyme responsible for ORF1 polyprotein processing leading to cleavage of the non-structural enzymes involved in virus replication. HEV-protease region encoding 432–592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of HEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of the enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation coefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r(2) = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to Papain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hence, we propose that HEV-protease has characteristics of “Papain-like cysteine protease,” as determined through structural homology, active site residues and class-specific inhibition. However, conclusive nature of the enzyme remains to be established.","time":1579759200000,"url":"10.3389/fcimb.2019.00478","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Transmission of COVID-19 in the terminal stage of incubation period: a familial cluster","source":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"Abstract We report a familial cluster of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to evidence that a potential transmission of the COVID-19 during the incubation period.

Advances in diagnostic technology contribute to the accurate detection of viruses. We performed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the viral etiology in pediatric patients and compared the detection rates with those determined using traditional antigen tests and virus cultures. Fifteen respiratory viruses were included in our investigation: respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV), influenza virus A (FluA) and influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1–4, human rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (Boca). In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses. In the future, further application of PCR may contribute to the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses and could improve patient outcomes.","time":1579068000000,"url":"10.3390/ijerph17020564","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Population- and Variant-Based Genome Analyses of Viruses from Vaccine-Derived Rabies Cases Demonstrate Product Specific Clusters and Unique Patterns","source":"Viruses","keywords":[{"term":"North America","category":"Location"},{"term":"Street","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Alabama","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Dufferin","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Canada","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Poland","category":"Nation"},{"term":"SAD","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ERA","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Vaccine-Derived Rabies Cases Demonstrate","category":"Organization"},{"term":"Unique Patterns","category":"Other"}],"body":"Rabies in wildlife has been successfully controlled in parts of Europe and North America using oral rabies vaccination, i.e., the distribution of baits containing live-attenuated virus strains.

How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: “there is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic”.2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak “creates a sense of déjà vu” with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan,4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918–19 influenza pandemic.5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called “trained incapacity”—“that state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses”.6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, “a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing—a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B”.","time":1584662400000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30468-2","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Has China faced only a herald wave of SARS-CoV-2?","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"Diamond","category":"Other"},{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Wuhan","category":"Location"}],"body":"The attack rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calculated by mathematical models, from estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2–3, suggests that 50–60% of the population should eventually be infected because the population seems to be entirely naive to the new virus.1 The observed attack rate on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained slightly below 20% (705 of 3711 passengers and crew members became infected).1 It is of upmost importance to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China is subsiding, as local authorities and the entire international community might wish. With 80 026 COVID-19 cases officially reported from China as of March 2, 2020,2 the proportion of the population affected remains far from 50%, or even 20%, of China's 1·4 billion people. Has China just experienced a herald wave, to use terminology borrowed from those who study tsunamis, and is the big wave still to come? Serosurveys can help answer these questions precisely.3 To serosurvey the outbreak would involve testing sera of blood samples from the most representative sample of the population at the epicentre of the epidemic, Wuhan. Serology analysis with neutralising antibodies from the 1000 people could allow for the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections to be estimated with good accuracy. This rate could be extrapolated to the city's entire population and thus inform more precisely whether the provisional attack rate during this period was a few cases per thousand or perhaps affected 1–2% of the population, 20%, or more. Serosurveys should be seen as polls before elections; they can be repeated several times,3 week after week, to monitor the epidemic precisely. There is no reason to wait for the end of the epidemic before doing serosurveys.

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0).

The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. Methods We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. Findings Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. Interpretation Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. Findings A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later. Interpretation Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study.

The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections—SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012—both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS–CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","time":1582243200000,"url":"10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of human metapneumovirus strains from Kenya and Zambia","source":"BMC Genomics","keywords":[{"term":"71.3","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Kenya","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Zambia","category":"Nation"}],"body":"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children.

Recently we have identified that the peptide PH((1–110)) from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles. We have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines. However, the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized. In addition, the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated. RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties.

Therefore, the thermal control of dry fomites has the potential to control bacterial survival on high-touch surfaces in hospitals.","time":1577426400000,"url":"10.1371/journal.pone.0226952","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Chinese medical personnel against the 2019-nCoV","source":"Journal of Infection","keywords":[{"term":"China","category":"Nation"},{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"}],"body":"","time":1582243200000,"url":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.011","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Latest assessment on COVID-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)","source":"Eurosurveillance","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","category":"Organization"},{"term":"ECDC","category":"Organization"}],"body":"","time":1582761600000,"url":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.8.2002271","urlToImage":""},{"title":"What you need to know","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"Michael Le Page","category":"Other"},{"term":"Jessica Hamzelou","category":"Other"}],"body":"From symptoms and fatality rate to stockpiling and caring for family, Michael Le Page and Jessica Hamzelou have the answers","time":1583539200000,"url":"10.1016/S0262-4079(20)30475-9","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Are high-performing health systems resilient against the COVID-19 epidemic?","source":"The Lancet","keywords":[{"term":"COVID-19","category":"COVID-19"},{"term":"Hong Kong","category":"Location"},{"term":"Singapore","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Japan","category":"Nation"},{"term":"Leung GM","category":"Other"}],"body":"As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was increased in all three locations, although expansion of the diagnostic capacity to university and large private laboratories in Japan is still ongoing. In Hong Kong, initially, only pneumonia patients without a microbiological diagnosis were tested, but surveillance has been broadened to include all inpatients with pneumonia and a purposively sampled proportion of outpatients and emergency attendees totalling about 1500 per day (Leung GM, unpublished). Japan's testing strategy has also evolved with diagnostic tests now offered to all suspected cases irrespective of their travel history; however, there are reports of cases that should have been tested but were not.","time":1584662400000,"url":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30551-1","urlToImage":""},{"title":"Calculating virus spread","source":"New Scientist","keywords":[{"term":"Adam KucharskiCalculating","category":"Other"}],"body":"Getting a full picture of the coronavirus outbreak is extremely difficult.
