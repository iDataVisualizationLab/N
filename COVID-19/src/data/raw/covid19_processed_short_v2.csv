However, elimination of non-specific amplification remains a key challenge for the optimization of LAMP assays. Here, using chlamydia DNA as a clinically relevant target and high-throughput sequencing as an analytical tool, we investigate a potential mechanism of non-specific amplification. We then develop a real-time digital LAMP (dLAMP) with high-resolution melting temperature (HRM) analysis and use this single-molecule approach to analyze approximately 1.2 million amplification events. We show that single-molecule HRM provides insight into specific and non-specific amplification in LAMP that are difficult to deduce from bulk measurements. We use real-time dLAMP with HRM to evaluate differences between polymerase enzymes, the impact of assay parameters (e.g. time, rate or florescence intensity), and the effect background human DNA. By differentiating true and false positives, HRM enables determination of the optimal assay and analysis parameters that leads to the lowest limit of detection (LOD) in a digital isothermal amplification assay.",,comm_use_subset,ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG,PMC,cc-by,,LAMP|HRM|1.2 million|HRM|LAMP|HRM|HRM|LOD,10.1093/nar/gkaa099

METHODS: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. RESULTS: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8(th) to February 28(th), 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: “low” (first), “moderate” (second), “high” (third), “high” (fourth), “high” (fifth), “high” (sixth), “high” (seventh), and “very high” (eighth).

In this article, an international analysis was performed on the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Data were retrieved from accurate databases according to the user’s guide of data sources for patient registries, CFR and recovery rates were calculated for each country. A comparison of CFR between countries with total cases ≥ 1,000 was observed for 12(th) and 23(rd) March. RESULTS: Italy’s CFR was the highest of all countries studied for both time points (12(th) March, 6.22% versus 23(rd) March, 9.26%). The data showed that even though Italy was the only European country reported on 12(rd) March, Spain and France had the highest CFR of 6.16 and 4.21%, respectively, on 23(rd) March, which was strikingly higher than the overall CFR of 3.61%. CONCLUSION: Obtaining detailed and accurate medical history from COVID-19 patients, and analyzing CFR alongside the recovery rate, may enable the identification of the highest risk areas so that efficient medical care may be provided. This may lead to the development of point-of-care tools to help clinicians in stratifying patients based on possible requirements in the level of care, to increase the probabilities of survival from COVID-19 disease.",,noncomm_use_subset,DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|NORP|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG,PMC,cc-by-nc-nd,,2019|COVID-19|CFR|CFR|23(rd) March|Italy|CFR|12(th|March|6.22%|23(rd|March|9.26%|Italy|European|12(rd) March|Spain|France|CFR|6.16|4.21%|23(rd) March|CFR|3.61%|COVID-19|CFR|COVID-19|Cross-Country Comparison of Case Fatality Rates,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.03

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines.

Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. SUMMARY: Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.",,custom_license,CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG,PMC,no-cc,,2|COVID-19|ACEI|RECENT FINDINGS|Wuhan|COVID-19|52|12%|enzyme 2|ACEI/ARB|COVID-19|ACEI/ARB|CoV|ACEI/ARB|COVID-19|ACC|HFSA|AHA|ESC Hypertension Council|ACEI/ARB,10.1007/s11886-020-01291-4

About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.",,comm_use_subset,DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON,PMC,cc-by,,December 2019|About 25%|ARDS|ICU|COVID-19|COVID-19|6|IL-6|Tocilizumab|COVID-19|COVID-19,10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3

Dans cette dernière éventualité interviennent des mécanismes épigénétiques. On rappellera d’abord différents types de modifications épigénétiques portant soit sur les histones de la chromatine, principalement des méthylations ou des acétylations ; soit sur l’ADN, par méthylation des cytosines. Des modifications de ce type suscitées par le tétrahydrocannabinol/THC du cannabis peuvent intervenir : soit au niveau des gamètes avant la procréation ; soit sur le fœtus pendant la gestation ; soit à différents moments de la vie de l’individu. À certaine de ces modifications épigénétiques est associé un accroissement de la vulnérabilité aux toxicomanies, impliquant les récepteurs D2 de la dopamine dans le noyau accumbens ; une surexpression de la synthèse du précurseur des enképhalines ; des modifications : des récepteurs CB1 des endocannabinoïdes ; des récepteurs de l’acide glutamique ; du GABA ; de protéines impliquées dans la plasticité synaptique, etc. Des modifications épigénétiques peuvent aussi affecter : le système immunitaire ; les activités cognitives ; le développement d’affections psychiatriques en relation avec des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale. Les connaissances qui s’accumulent à cet égard vont à l’opposé de la banalisation ambiante du cannabis. Elles imposent d’alerter les pouvoirs publics et le public, spécialement les jeunes, sur les risques associées à la consommation de cette drogue. Summary The almost pandemic spread of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, especially in France, justifies the attention given to the consequences, not only acute but also delayed, of this intoxication. In the latter case, epigenetic mechanisms occur. We will first recall various types of epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones, mainly methylations or acetylations; either DNA, by methylation of cytosines. Such modifications caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol/THC of cannabis can intervene: either at the level of gametes before procreation, or at different points of the life cycle. These epigenetic modifications are associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction, involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, overexpression of enkephalin precursor synthesis, modifications of: CB1 receptors of endocannabinoids, glutamic acid receptors, GABA receptors, proteins involved in synaptic plasticity ... These changes can also affect: immune system, cognitive activities, development of psychiatric diseases, related to disturbances of brain maturation. The knowledge that accumulates in this respect is the opposite of the ambient trivialization of this drug. They impose sending an alert to the public authorities and to the public, especially young people, warning on the risks associated with this drug use and abuse.",,custom_license,ORG|GPE|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|LOC|ORG|GPE|ORDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,Résumé La|France|l’attention|Dans|D2 de la|CB1|GABA|s’accumulent|l’opposé de la banalisation|d’alerter|France|first|D2|CB1|GABA,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.004

De multiples produits de synthèse sont désormais accessibles via internet : associé à la créativité des chimistes cela a participé à l'émergence de pratiques inédites allant du chemsex au purple drank. Les conduites addictives résultent d’un ensemble de facteurs individuels (vulnérabilités biologique et psychique) et contextuels (disponibilité et banalisation du toxique dans l’environnement). Les pathologies mentales autres sont des facteurs de vulnérabilité à la pathologie addictive, tout comme les conduites addictives peuvent révéler une pathologie émotionnelle ou psychotique.

Addictive behaviours result from a combination of individual factors (biological and psychological vulnerability) and contextual factors (availability and triviality of the toxicant in the environment). Other mental disorders are factors of vulnerability to addictive pathology as well as the addictive behaviours can reveal an emotional or psychotic pathology.

It is also in part an introductory review to relevant computational techniques for tackling viral threats, using COVID-19 as an example. Q-UEL tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bioinformatics tools were again used for efficiency, but the focus in this paper is even more on the virus. Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV of the S2′ spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage site continues to appear important. Here it is shown to be recognizable in the common cold coronaviruses, avian coronaviruses and possibly as traces in the nidoviruses of reptiles and fish. Its function or functions thus seem important to the coronaviruses. It might represent SARS-CoV-2 Achilles’ Heel, less likely to acquire resistance by mutation, as has happened in some early SARS vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper. Preliminary conformational analysis of the receptor (ACE2) binding site of the spike protein is carried suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved, it appears to be more variable than KRSFIEDLLFNKV. However compounds like emodin that inhibit SARS entry, apparently by binding ACE2, might also have functions at several different human protein binding studies. The enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model pharmacophore perhaps representing an ensemble of targets, and it is noted that it occurs both in lung and alimentary tract. Perhaps it benefits the virus to block an inflammatory response by inhibiting the dehydrogenase, but a fairly complex web involves several possible targets.",,custom_license,ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON,Elsevier,els-covid,,COVID-19|KRSFIEDLLFNKV|S2′|Achilles’ Heel|KRSFIEDLLFNKV|11β-hydroxysteroid|1|COVID-19 Coronavirus,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103749

Cumulative number of new confirmed case and death are still increasing out of China. However, the independent predicted factors associated with the fatal outcome remain uncertain. Methods A retrospective cohort of 1590 hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 throughout China was established. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed using Kapla-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patient with COVID-19. Results In this nationwide cohort, non-survivors showed higher incidence of elderly people, subjects with co-existing chronic illness, dyspnea and laboratory abnormalities on admission, compared with survivors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age≥75 (HR: 7.86, 95% CI: 2.44-25.35), age between 65-74 years (HR:3.43, 95%CI: 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR:4.28, 95%CI:1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease(HR:3.1, 95%CI:1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR: 3.96, 95%CI:1.42-11), procalcitonin>0.5ng/ml(HR:8.72, 95%CI:3.42-22.28), aspartate aminotransferase>40U/liter (HR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1- 6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis. The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with the C-index of 0.91 (95%CI 0.85-0.97). The calibration plots also demonstrated good consistence between the prediction and the observation. Conclusions The proposed nomogram accurately predict clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.

The coronavirus spike proteins are very effective molecular mechanisms, which provide the coronavirus entrance to the host cell. The number of these spikes is different; it dramatically depends on external conditions and determines the degree of danger of the virus. A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger. This paper describes a mathematical model of the shape of coronavirus virions. Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.",,custom_license,PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,Coronavirus|two|200,10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107005

Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. Results Of 140 patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, 51.4% were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 ≤90% were older, more likely to be men, to have hypertension and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 >90%. Overall, 36 (25.7%) patients died during hospitalization after a median 14-day follow-up. Higher post-oxygen supplementation SpO2 levels were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-unit SpO2 0.93, 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.95, P < .001). SpO2 cutoff of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.60; 95% confidence interval 1.24-5.43, P = .01).

Desafortunadamente, a día de hoy no existe ninguna vacuna específica para el virus COVID-19, y el tratamiento está siendo de soporte con añadido de antivirales y otros fármacos, sin que hasta la fecha se haya evidenciado un beneficio claro. Muchos de estos pacientes se deterioran rápidamente y requieren ser intubados y ventilados mecánicamente, lo que está provocando el colapso del sistema sanitario en muchos países debido a la falta de ventiladores y de camas de críticos. En este documento revisamos dos terapias adyuvantes sencillas de aplicar, sin efectos deletéreos y de un coste bajo que podrían ser de utilidad para el tratamiento de la infección por coronavirus agudo severo asociado al síndrome respiratorio agudo (SARS-CoV-2). La vitaminaC, un potente antioxidante, se ha convertido en una terapia relevante debido a sus beneficios potenciales cuando se administra por vía intravenosa. El efecto potencial de la vitaminaC en la reducción de la inflamación en los pulmones podría desempeñar un papel clave en la lesión pulmonar causada por la infección por coronavirus. Otra posible terapia eficaz es el ozono. Pese a la controversia que siempre le ha acompañado, se ha estudiado y utilizado ampliamente durante muchos años y su eficacia se ha demostrado en múltiples estudios. Sin embargo, nuestro objetivo no es hacer una revisión exhaustiva de dichas terapias sino difundir sus efectos beneficiosos. Obviamente, los ensayos clínicos son necesarios, pero dado el potencial beneficio de estas terapias, recomendamos incorporarlas al arsenal terapéutico para el tratamiento del SARS-CoV-2. Abstract Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.",,custom_license,ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,Resumen La|Wuhan|China|de 2019|Desafortunadamente|COVID-19|Muchos de|La vitaminaC|de la|Obviamente|Pneumonia|Wuhan|China|late 2019|COVID-19|two|many years|two,10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.004

Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (−45 to −51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (−28 to −31.0%). By contrast, O3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th. There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences.",,custom_license,PERSON|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|DATE|DATE|PRODUCT|ORG|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE,Elsevier,els-covid,,Lockdown|Spain|March 14th|two weeks|Barcelona|Spain|two weeks|BC|−45|−51%|PM10|−28|−31.0%|O3|33 to +57%|8|O3|NOx|VOC|two|PM10|SO2|weeks|March 30th|PM10|BC|NO2|Barcelona|Spain|one month,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138540

Methods All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed (via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit). The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated. Results Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visit in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visit decreased from 63% to 9% during week 1 and 4, respectively. 74% of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection). The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20-69) and 65 years old (range 37-88), respectively. Conclusions A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the healthcare delivery. 45% visits were canceled without rescheduling. Although a minimum portion of face-to-face visit (<10% one month after the lockdown) was preserved mostly for suspected malignancy or potentially life-threatening conditions, telemedicine proved a pragmatic approach allowing efficient screening of cases and adequate protection for patients and clinicians.",,custom_license,ORG|LOC|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,"Department of Urology|Northern Italy|Covid-19|the 4 weeks|March 9-April 3, 2020|the Department of Urology|the Trento Province|Italy|Expert|415|928|45%|523|55%|295|56%|228|44%|63%|9%|week 1 and 4|74%|59|20-69|65 years old|37-88|45%|10%|one month|TELEUROLOGY|THE TIME OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC|STAY",10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.004

Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. Objective The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. Results We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

Between 5% and 30% of patients affected by this disease require management in an intensive care unit. Different documents have been published with recommendations for the general population. However, in the obstetric patient, the scientific evidence is limited, and even more so when it comes to COVID-19 infection in obstetric intensive care settings. For this reason, an unsystematic narrative review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, scientific societies, as well as the repositories of the World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia as sources of information, in order to describe the management of a pregnant patient with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. It is emphasised that care must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, using maternal and fetal monitoring when appropriate. It is also suggested that there must be monitoring of oxygen saturation and maternal haemodynamics in order to minimise fetal hypoxaemia.

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.",,custom_license,CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|NORP|DATE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE,Elsevier,els-covid,,"2|over 100|weeks|China|more than 90%|Italy|Italian|daily|Italy|between March 1 and March 11, 2020|between 9% and 11%|Feb 21|Italy|1 more week|30|up to 4000|mid-April, 2020|the next few days|weeks|Italian|Hubei|China|3–4 days|China|Italy",10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30627-9

Methods Asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid testing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively enrolled. The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed. Results 58 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between Jan 1, 2020 and Feb 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. On admission, patients had no symptoms and laboratory findings were normal. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cohort was ground glass opacity (GGO) (55, 94.8%) with peripheral (44, 75.9%) distribution, unilateral location (34, 58.6%) and mostly involving one or two lobes (38, 65.5%), often accompanied by characteristic signs. After short-term follow-up, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms with lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP, mainly including fever, cough and fatigue. The evolution of lesions on CT imaging were observed in 10 patients (17.2%). The average days of hospitalization was19.80±10.82 days, and was significantly longer in progression patients (28.60±7.55 day). Conclusion CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has definite characteristics. Since asymptomatic infections as “covert transmitter”, and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term.

Under such circumstance pregnant women are also affected significantly. Objective This study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19. Methods The research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years. These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed. Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition). Results There were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group. In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p>0.05). Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group. The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p>0.05). During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p<0.05). 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 hours after birth and no case was tested positive. Conclusion The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women.

Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results : Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions : Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.",,custom_license,PERSON,Elsevier,els-covid,,Method,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945

In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an enormous level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases.

Recently, Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection was found to hijack the VCP protein. However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71.",,custom_license,GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|LOC|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE,Elsevier,els-covid,,Enterovirus|EVA71|VCP|VCP|EVA71|RNA|VCP|ATPase|EVA71|31|siRNA|ER|1|NPL4|NPL4|EVA71|EVA71|RNA|VCP|UFD1|Enterovirus|EVA71|EVA71|VCP|EVA71|VCP/UFD1/Nucleolin|Enterovirus,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197974

In order to gain insight into the emergence, evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, a comprehensive analysis of genome composition and codon usage of βCoV circulating in China was performed. A biased nucleotide composition was found for SARS-CoV-2 genome. This bias in genomic composition is reflected in its codon and amino acid usage patterns. The overall codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased. Most of the highly frequent codons are A- and U-ending, which strongly suggests that mutational bias is the main force shaping codon usage in this virus. Significant differences in relative synonymous codon usage frequencies among SARS-CoV-2 and human cells were found.

The study presents a European cross-country comparison, analysing both the National Health Service (NHS) outsourcing in England (public-to-private outsourcing) and the Regional Health Service (RHS) outsourcing in the Tuscany region (Italy) (public-to-public outsourcing). Specificities and commonalities of the two outsourcing experiences provide suggestions for managers and policy-makers and enhance the current knowledge of outsourcing in the public healthcare sector.",,custom_license,CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|FAC|GPE|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,two|European|the National Health Service|NHS|England|the Regional Health Service|Tuscany region|Italy|two,10.1016/j.emj.2020.04.002

At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality. A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting. Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge. However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres. Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases). Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%). Our real-life data contextualise ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the current COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery. We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced. Patient summary: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres to evaluate how many surgeries performed for prostate, bladder, kidney, and upper tract urothelial cancer can be postponed in times of emergency. We found that approximately two-thirds of patients with these cancers do not require high-priority surgery. Conversely, of patients requiring high-priority surgery, approximately one in four is considered at high perioperative risk. These patients may pose challenges in allocation of resources in critical scenarios such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.",,custom_license,DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,2019|COVID-19|Italy|three|Italian|2387|32.3%|12.6%|17.3%|33.9%|36.2%|26.4%|American Society of Anesthesiologists|50%|COVID-19|approximately two-thirds|three|Italian|approximately two-thirds|approximately one|four|COVID-19|the Burden of Nondeferrable Major Uro-oncologic|Surgery to Guide Prioritisation Strategies|the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights|Three|Italian|Referral Centres,10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.054

By conducting high-resolution CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid mixed droplets (initial diameter 10 μm and 50 μm, solid to liquid ratio is 1:9) exhaled in a coach bus with 14 thermal manikins. Five air-conditioning supply directions and ambient relative humidity (RH = 35% and 95%) are considered. Results show that ventilation effectiveness, RH and initial droplet size significantly influence droplet transmissions in coach bus. 50 μm droplets tend to evaporate completely within 1.8 s and 7 s as RH = 35% and 95% respectively, while 0.2 s or less for 10 μm droplets. Thus 10 μm droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50 μm droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85%-100% of droplets deposit on object surfaces.",,custom_license,ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|QUANTITY|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT,Elsevier,els-covid,,CFD|10|50|1:9|14|Five|RH|35%|95%|RH|50|1.8 s and|7 s|RH|35%|95%|0.2|10|10|50|RH|85%-100%,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122609

Consequently, a variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles in continuous airflow conditions. However, since aerosolized infectious viral-testing is inadvisable due to safety concerns, their anti-viral capability has only been tested by inserting the filters into liquid media, where infectious virus particles disperse. In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus. After ensuring the relationship did not depend on the virus species, the correlation was used to derive the results of the air-medium test from the results of the liquid-medium test.",,custom_license,ORDINAL|ORDINAL|QUANTITY|ORG|PERSON,Elsevier,els-covid,,Firstly|Secondly|two|Air Filter Anti-Viral Efficiency|Airborne Infectious Virus,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122640

This study analyzed the genetic characteristics of the spike (S) gene of 33 FCoVs circulating in Northern Italy between 2011 and 2015 in cats with or without FIP. In order to reconstruct the most probable places of origin and dispersion of FCoV among Italian cats, a phylogeographic approach was performed based on 106 FCoV S gene partial sequences from cats, including the 33 novel Italian sequences and 73 retrieved from public databases. Only FCoV type I was found in the Italian cats. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of FCoV was 2.4 × 10-2 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 1.3-3.7 × 10-2), confirming the high genetic variability in the circulating strains. All the isolates clustered in a unique highly significant clade that likely originated from USA between the 1950s and the 1970s, confirming the first descriptions of the disease in American cats. Our results suggest that from USA the virus likely entered Germany and thereafter spread to other European countries. Phylogeography showed that sequences segregated mainly by geographical origin. In the 2010s Italian sequences clustered in different subclades, confirming that different strains cocirculate in Italy. Further studies on archival samples and other genetic regions of FCoV are suggested in order to confirm the present results and to reconstruct a more in-depth detailed virus dispersion pattern for the definition of possible control measures.",,custom_license,DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|DATE|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORDINAL|NORP|GPE|GPE|NORP|PERSON|ORDINAL|NORP|GPE|ORG|DATE|LOC,Elsevier,els-covid,,Feline|FCoV|Feline|FIP|one|33|Northern Italy|between 2011 and 2015|FIP|FCoV|Italian|106|FCoV S|33|Italian|73|Italian|FCoV|2.4|10-2|/year|95%|1.3|10-2|USA|between the 1950s|the 1970s|first|American|USA|Germany|European|Phylogeography|2010s|Italian|Italy|FCoV|Feline|Northern Italy,10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108667

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. Objectives This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords “COVID 19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “treatment.” All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. Discussion There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Glucocorticoids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. Conclusion There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.",,custom_license,ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|non-steroidal|ACE|PubMed|SCOPUS|CRS|ARDS|COVID-19|Pharmacotherapy|COVID-19,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.035

This pioneering study systematically investigates how Chinese central government agencies used social media to promote citizen engagement during the COVID-19 crisis. Using data scraped from ‘Healthy China’, an official Sina Weibo account of the National Health Commission of China, we examine how citizen engagement relates to a series of theoretically relevant factors, including media richness, dialogic loop, content type and emotional valence. Results show that media richness negatively predicts citizen engagement through government social media, but dialogic loop facilitates engagement. Information relating to the latest news about the crisis and the government's handling of the event positively affects citizen engagement through government social media.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.",,custom_license,CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,19|COVID-19|individuals’|COVID-19|weeks|months|COVID-19|COVID-19|Neuropsychiatric,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027

Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 second-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p<0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p>0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.",,custom_license,ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|NORP|DATE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|EVENT|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE,Elsevier,els-covid,,Coronavirus|2019|COVID-19|four weeks later|COVID-19|1738|190|Chinese|1210|first|861|second|333|the Impact of Event Scale-Revised|Depression|Anxiety|DASS-21|DASS|32.98|30.76|4 weeks|second|24|8.1%|28.8%|16.5%|p>0.05|COVID-19|COVID-19|the Mental Health of General Population|China,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028

Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

Although the use of acetylsalicylic acid (AAS) in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) remains the standard therapy to KD, the etiology, genetic susceptibility genes and pathogenic factors of KD are still un-elucidated. Purpose Current obstacles in the treatment of KD include the lack of standard clinical and genetic markers for early diagnosis, possible severe side effect of AAS (Reye's syndrome), and the refractory KD cases with resistance to IVIG therapy, therefore, this review has focused on introducing the current advances in the identification of genetic susceptibility genes, environmental factors, diagnostic markers and adjuvant pharmacological intervention for KD. Results With an overall update in the development of KD from different aspects, our current bioinformatics data has suggested CASP3, CD40 and TLR4 as the possible pathogenic factors or diagnostic markers of KD. Besides, a list of herbal medicines which may work as the adjunct therapy for KD via targeting different proposed molecular targets of KD have also been summarized. Conclusion With the aid of modern pharmacological research and technology, it is anticipated that novel therapeutic remedies, especially active herbal chemicals targeting precise clinical markers of KD could be developed for accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",,custom_license,GPE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|WORK_OF_ART|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,KD|under 5 years old|AAS|IVIG|KD|KD|KD|AAS (Reye's syndrome|KD|KD|KD|CD40|TLR4|KD|KD|KD|KD|Kawasaki|Kawasaki,10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208

Pathogens in turn encode numerous factors that inhibit nearly all steps of cGAS-STING signal transduction. From masking of cytosolic DNA ligands, to post-translational modification of cGAS and STING, and degradation of the nucleotide second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP, pathogens have evolved convergent mechanisms to evade cGAS-STING sensing. Here we examine pathogen inhibitors of innate immunity in the context of newly discovered regulatory features controlling cellular cGAS-STING activation. Comparative analysis of these strategies provides insight into mechanisms of action and suggests aspects of cGAS-STING regulation and immune evasion that remain to be discovered.",,custom_license,PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,cGAS|STING|2′3′-cGAMP,10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.002

We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides.

Secreted proteins need to be delivered directly to the cell surface. Sorting of secreted proteins from the Golgi apparatus has been a topic of interest for over thirty years, yet there is still no clear understanding of the machinery that forms the post-Golgi carriers. Most evidence points to these post-Golgi carriers being tubular pleomorphic structures that bud from the trans-face of the Golgi.

As the case count amongst children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better understand the virus and the disease. Cases In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19 paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy. Discussion There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected children. Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who tested negative was an ethical dilemma. Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These issues have implications for infection control. Consequently, there is a need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in the management of COVID-19 in children.",,custom_license,CARDINAL|GPE|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE,Elsevier,els-covid,,4|Malaysia|first|Wuhan|China|60|more than 85000|Malaysia|end of February 2020|four|20 months to 11 years|four|China|2|Firstly|Secondly|COVID-19|Four|Paediatric Cases|Malaysia,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.049

In line with the One-Health concept, extending the target of the studies to the animals which humans are continuously interacting with may favor a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenetic mechanisms; thus, helping to adopt the most suitable containment measures. The last two decades have already faced severe manifestations of the coronavirus infection in both humans and animals, thus, circulating epitopes from previous outbreaks might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the present study, we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes and compare them with the homologues of taxonomically-related coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world. Protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated proteins. Moreover, structural epitope mapping by homology modelling revealed a potential immunogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins.

The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30% of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. Conclusions This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years.",,custom_license,ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE,Elsevier,els-covid,,Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|301|COVID-19|Tongji Hospital|Wuhan|China|RT-PCR|301|COVID-19|58 years|51.2%|RT-PCR|16 days|10-23|301|RT-PCR|20 days|17-24|216|years|22 days|19 days|two|70|30%|third|RT|1113|RT|301|20 days|more than 2|years|RT-PCR|301|Wuhan|China,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104346

Objectives To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. Study design Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). Results Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2–14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients Conclusions Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.",,custom_license,DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|MONEY|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,December 2019|2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|China|10|2|Western Chongqing|China|Ten|RT-PCR|The People's Hospital of Dazu District|Chongqing|the first day|Treatment Guideline|COVID-19|5th|China|10|Wuhan|56.5 years|11.16|six|2–14 days|Dry|three|Chest|61|180|348|19|25|26|Neutrophil-lymphocyte|Conclusions Initial|RT-PCR-CT|COVID-19|COVID-19,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104360

Methods The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results All Patients were divided into severe (69) and non-severe group (135). Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3 + T cell, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, B cell (CD19+) and NK cell (CD16 + 56+), were significantly lower in severe group (P＜0.001). The dynamic levels of T lymphocytes in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level. The cut-off value of the counts of CD3+ (576), CD4+ (391) and CD8+ (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19. Conclusion Our results shown that the decrease of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8 + T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases. The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methylene blue-plasma (MBP) has been used for over 20 years, but its efficacy in this setting remains controversial. Patients and methods: this is a comparative analysis of the experience of two Centres, with different plasma products, to evaluate their efficacy in TTP. One centre used quarantine plasma (QP), and MBP the other. We performed a retrospective longitudinal study, analysing the clinical files of TTP patients of a 13-year data evaluation period. Duration of treatment and transfusion parameters, medical record, laboratory testing, concomitant medication, and survival rate, were assessed for every episode. Results During the study period, 12 (55.5 %) and 10 (45.5 %) new cases were treated with QP and MBP, respectively. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of TPE processes, days elapsed from diagnosis to TPE, and plasma volume transfused. The QP TPE episodes of treatment were significantly associated with an increased time to recovery compared with MBP episodes of treatment (p = 0.004). Conclusion MBP was as effective as QP in the treatment of TTP patients. Since recovery was more favourable when MBP was used, we consider MBP remains a suitable alternative to treat TTP patients.",,custom_license,ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE,Elsevier,els-covid,,Abstract Introduction Therapeutic plasma|first|MBP|20 years|two|TTP|One|MBP|12|55.5 %|10 (45.5 %|QP|MBP|days|QP|MBP|Conclusion MBP|QP|MBP|MBP|Comparison,10.1016/j.transci.2020.102771

Methods We conducted an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease.

Methods The PDIS method is based on photodiagnostic physics and high resolution spectroscopy and is using calibrated spectroscopic data for the diagnostic analysis of the blood screening spectra. Using Confocal Laser Scanning Mikcroscopy the Indocyangreen-uptake of different cell lines of breast cancer cells is studied. Results The PDIS supplies calibrated diagnostic data about the presence or absence of CTCs and CTC clusters in the bloodstream with a sensitivity of 98 %. Therefore, the PDIS is suited to control the blood of cancer patients with respect of CTC and CTC clusters with an resolution of one CTC and one CTC cluster per blood volume. PDIS distinguishes the different phenotypes of CTC clusters. Conclusion Circulating tumor cell slusters play a key role in the metastatic process and are formed only in solid tumors, they are appropriate objects to validate cancer treatments and to recognice cancer formation. The PDIS is a calibrated diagnostic method which allows to evaluate the results of solid tumor treatments and of chemotherapy treatments and to optimize the individual cancer treatment strategies.",,custom_license,ORG|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON,Elsevier,els-covid,,the Photodiagnostic Infrared Spectroscoppy (PDIS|Confocal Laser|Indocyangreen|PDIS|CTC|98 %|PDIS|CTC|CTC|one|CTC|one|CTC|CTC|PDIS,10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101755

After announcing lockdown in Italy on the 9 March 2020, situation is becoming stable since last days of March. In view of this, it is important to forecast the evolution of the Italy situation and the possible effects if this lock down would continue for another two months. Methods Patient statistics were extracted from Italian Health Ministry website where the COVID-19 outbreak of reproductive cases and recovered cases based on last 45 days are reported. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA encompasses the forecast package in R to predict. Results Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of positive cases might reach the value of 182,757 and forecasting of recovered cases might reach the value of 81,635 at end of May if the lock down is continuous.

Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention. Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes. However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. Despite the strategic implementation of these measures, the number of new reported cases continues to rise at a profoundly alarming rate.

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. Methods Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. Results The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period. Conclusions We are still at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and scientific evidence is still scarce and incomplete, so these ABORL-CCF recommendations for otorhinolaryngologists may be updated based on new knowledge and the pattern of the new coronavirus spread.",,custom_license,ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology|Cervical-Facial Surgery|ABORL|Methods Review|COVID-19|COVID-19|ENT|COVID-19|COVID-19|ABORL|a Brazilian Association of Otolaryngology and Cervicofacial Surgery|ABORL,10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.04.002

Additionally, human-adapted HAs gain glycosylation sites over time, although their biological function is poorly defined. Using quantitative glycomic analysis, we show that HAs from human pandemic viruses exhibit significant proportions of high-mannose type N-linked glycans throughout the head domain. By contrast, poorly adapted avian-origin HAs contain predominately complex-type glycans, which have greater structural diversity. Although oligomannose levels vary, they are present in all tested recombinant HAs and whole viruses and can be specifically targeted for universal detection. The positions of high-mannose glycosites on the HA of human H1N1 and H3N2 strains are conserved. Additionally, high-mannose-binding lectins possess a broad capacity to neutralize and prevent infection with contemporary H3N2 strains.

We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n=5) and purpuric skin rash (n=3). The pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the inter-alveolar septa by neutrophils. No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic ARDS, were not prominent. These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the alternative and lectin-based complement pathways. The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin. In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the inter-alveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of two cases examined. In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state. It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific intervention.",,custom_license,PERSON|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,coronavirus-2|Coronavirus|2019|COVID-19|5|COVID-19|COVID-19|ARDS|two|COVID-19|COVID-19|Complement|COVID-19|five,10.1016/j.trsl.2020.04.007

It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. Methods In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. Results Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.

This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is utilizing social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence. Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging.

A psychiatric evaluation of three strategies to promote political climate action","ABSTRACT This qualitative study analyzes the lack of political action to address climate change using a psychiatric lens, and frames that ambivalence lies at the core of inaction. While most politicians understand that climate action is absolutely necessary, any significant action is stalled by a number of important barriers they have to overcome. Using clinical analogies from eating disorders and the scientific literature on motivational change, this paper analyses three current strategies that push for political action. First, using force and emotions (like confronting activists) is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing politicians' resistance to change. Second, collaborative discussions in multilateral conferences and debates risk feeding verbal manifestos without enacting behavioural change. Withdrawal from the manifestos of politicians is a third strategy to push for change discussed in this paper. However, even after bypassing manifestos, this strategy is unlikely to succeed because the benefits of greenhouse gas emissions, linked to our current social norms, seriously outweigh the benefits of climate action. Overall, all three methods present severe flaws and are not viable solutions to help politicians implement climate action. Other enhanced options are likely to be necessary.",,custom_license,CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,Elsevier,els-covid,,three|First|Second|third|three|three,10.1016/j.erss.2020.101547

These vectors may also be designed to co-express type I interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect. Nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pWRG7077-based vaccines when delivered by IM injection, and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes. The Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol VEEV challenge as compared to the pWRG7077 VEEV DNA vaccine. Although all mice receiving the pWRG7077 and Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccines at the doses tested survived EBOV challenge, only mice receiving the Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccine that co-expresses the innate immune agonist genes failed to lose weight after challenge.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD).

Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|NORP|GPE|NORP|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON,biorxiv,biorxiv,,COVID-19|1|70|Ashkenazi|Jewish|1|172|Finnish European|1.43%|2.16%|Ashkenazi|0.58% and 1.24%|European|Finland|East Asians|1%|hundreds of thousands|ACE 2 Coding Variants|Risk Factor,10.1101/2020.04.05.026633

This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning.

We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall infection incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale very favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario.

Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes. We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea. We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not.

Methods: This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cutoff on March 8, 2020. Results: A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive COVID-19 PCR detection rates. Patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2 (P = 0.064). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.

A GRADE rapid review on the N95 respirators effectiveness.,"Background Protecting Health Care Workers (HCWs) during routine care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is of paramount importance to halt the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2) pandemic. The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Findings Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR= 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. Interpretation We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,"Protecting Health Care Workers|COVID-19|WHO|ECDC|CDC|N95|PubMed|Embase|The Cochrane Library|March 21, 2020|N95|COVID-19|GRADE|Four|8736|COVID-19|73|95%|CI|46-91|1000|2|2594|N95|0.41|95%CI|0.28|N95|N95|N95|Healthcare Workers|COVID-19|GRADE|N95",10.1101/2020.04.06.20054841

The current diagnosis and treatment guidelines are still need to be improved, and more excellent clinical experience is needed to provide reference. Methods： We analyzed and summarized clinical data of 97 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients (including 26 severe cases) admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, 2020 to March 10, 2020,included laboratory examination results, imaging findings, treatment effect, prognosis , etc, in order to put forward prediction index of severe COVID-19 patients, principles of early intervention and methylprednisolone usages in COVID-19 patients. Results： 1.Hypoxemia, hyperlactic acid, hypoproteinemia, and hypokalemia were prevalent in COVID-19 patients.The significant low lymphocyte count, hypoproteinemia, hypokalemia, the persistent or worsen high CRP, high D-dimer, and high BNP, and the occurrence of hemoptysis and novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viremia were important indicators for early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease progression. 2.Characteristic images of lung CT had a clear change in COVID - 19, Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and high-density linear combinations may indicate different pathological changes. Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of severe disease. 3.Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 . 4. According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases, appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19 patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: 1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,"97|COVID-19|26|the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University|January 17, 2020 to March 10|COVID-19|D-dimer|BNP|2.Characteristic|CT|COVID - 19|GGO|GGO|3.Basic|COVID-19|4|COVID-19|COVID-19|2.Appropriate|COVID-19|COVID-19",10.1101/2020.04.06.20054890

In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions.

Findings: In this epidemiological study based on publicly available data, we develop a model that predicts vulnerability to COVID-19 for each US county in terms of likelihood of going from no documented cases to at least one case within five days and in terms of number of occurrences of the virus. Meaning: Predicting county vulnerability to COVID-19 can assist health organizations to better plan for resource and workforce needs. Abstract Importance: The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to rapidly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread. Objective: Developing county level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. Design: Original Investigation; Decision Analytical Model Study for County Level COVID-19 occurrences using data from March 14-31, 2020. Setting: Disease spread prediction for US counties. Participants: All US county level granularity based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. Exposure(s) (for observational studies): Daily county level reported COVID-19 occurrences from March 14-31, 2020. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We developed a 3-stage model to quantify, firstly the probability of COVID-19 occurrence for unaffected counties using XGBoost classifier and secondly, the number of potential occurrences of a county via XGBoost regression. Thirdly, these results are combined to compute the county level risk. This risk is then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. Results: Using data from March 14-31, 2020, the model shows a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%. Conclusions and Relevance: We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged 70 or greater and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We found a positive association between affected and urban counties as well as less vulnerable and rural counties. The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduces significant variation in reported cases and produces a bias in the model.

As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubei's data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the α-factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America. Methods: By dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient (α factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available. Findings: The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development. Interpretation: The analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The α factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|ORG|NORP|LOC|LOC|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|LOC|LOC,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|one million|Hubei|South Korea|Confirmed Cases|Hubei|COVID-19|10|European|Italy|Lombardia|European|Europe|South America|Covid-19|COVID-19|TCC|Analysing|COVID-19|Hubei|South Korea|March|Europe|South America,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055327

This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or atomizer and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass.

While the analogous event in China appears to be rather under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of the evolution. Italy at present is playing a major role in understanding transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. Methods: We combined a quarantined models with early stage evolution data in Italy (during February 20th - March 30th) to predict longer term evolution (March 30th, on ...) within different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnose rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework we analyze the possible event of a secondary infection after relaxing the isolation measures. Outcomes and interpretation: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side the contact rate must obviously kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter δ_I connected with the time t_I=1/δ_I needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy this time must fall under 12-8 hours in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers.

This epidemiological 'curve' refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made. Methods This work presents a Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT) which can be used by anyone. This tool allows the user to approximate and draw the curve and allows testing of assumptions, trajectories and the wildly varying figures reported in the media. The mathematics behind SCAT is clearly outlined here but understanding of this is not required. SCAT is provided online as a downloadable MS Excel workbook with some sample cases shown. Throughout this work, the parameters used are specified so that all results can be easily reproduced. Findings Although not intended as a prediction tool, SCAT has achieved less than 0.5 % error in short-term forward prediction. It also shows a very significant improvement on the pandemic exponential approximations found throughout media reporting. As a comparison tool, it highlights obvious differences between COVID-19 and other diseases, such as influenza, and between countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy and the UK are used here for demonstration purposes).

An open question is, what is the share of infections that are undetected under current testing guidelines? To answer this question, we turn to COVID-19 testing data from Iceland. The criteria for testing within the Icelandic medical system, processed by the National University Hospital of Iceland (NUHI), have also been targeted at high-risk individuals, but additionally most Icelanders qualify for voluntary testing through the biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics. We use results from Iceland's two testing programs to estimate the share of infections that are undetected under standard (NUHI) testing guidelines.

This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the known immunological benefits of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation. One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection). Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|WORK_OF_ART|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|one|BCG|BCG|first|at least 2|BCG|One|BCG|BCG|COVID19|BCG|Between BCG Policy is Significantly Confounded by Age|Alter Infection,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055616

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24--65% (and peak deaths 15--69%), compared to 2--9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9--18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|EVENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|COVID-19|US|New York|Washington|COVID-19|Hypothetical|Washington|New York|80%|50%|17--45%|two months|New York|daily|34--58%|20%|Washington|80%|24|%|15--69%|2|New York|9--18%|Modeling|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055624

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious pneumonia that may result in progressive respiratory failure and death. What are the goals of this investigation? This study explains the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths and suggests general lessons learned for a strategy to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19 to reduce viral infectivity and negative impacts in economic systems and society. What are the results of this study? The main results are: o The accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution. o Hinterland cities have average days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) equal to 80 days, and an average number of infected more than 2,000 individuals as of April 1st, 2020, coastal cities have days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 equal to 60 days and have about 700 infected in average. o Cities that average number of 125 days exceeding the limits set for PM10, last year, they have an average number of infected individual higher than 3,200 units, whereas cities having less than 100 days (average number of 48 days) exceeding the limits set for PM10, they have an average number of about 900 infected individuals. o The results reveal that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in specific environments is due to two mechanisms given by: air pollution-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission; in particular, the mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission play a critical role rather than human-to-human transmission. o The finding here suggests that to minimize future epidemic similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological condition, is less than 50 days. After this critical threshold, the analytical output here suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions (with high moisture%, low wind speed and fog) trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (accelerated epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population, economy and society. What is a socioeconomic strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19? Considering the complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity, lessons learned for COVID-19 have to be applied for a proactive socioeconomic strategy to cope with future epidemics, especially an environmental policy based on reduction of air pollution mainly in hinterland zones of countries, having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog that create an environment that can damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission of viral infectivity similar to the COVID-19.

The resulting flattened curve remain exponential and may still exceed available healthcare resources and capacity during and around its peak. Moreover, while isolation and containment can scale down daily cases significantly, such a mitigation strategy also prolong the outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely having disasterous repercussions. Mitigation for the duration of the outbreak may therefore be unsustainable and risk a second wave of infections. The method for active pandemic curve management (MAPCM) presented herein has the potential to shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which equates to the ramping up of economic activity, and it leaves breathing room for the economy from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as projected hospitalizations per day) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak. To be successful the method must be implemented early enough in the outbreak. Implementing the method incorrectly can result in a herd immunity levels of infections.

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n=30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56+/-0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47+/-0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82+/-2.95 days. We assume that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific and the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different communities, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n=50 states, we adopted the latent and infectious periods from China, and found a contact period of 3.38+/-0.69 days. With no additional mitigation strategies, our epidemic network model predicts a basic reproduction number of 5.3+/-0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections across the United States.

We also estimated the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) and age restrictions on these estimates. Methods: Our secondary analyses estimated hospital worker infections in the US based on health worker infection and death rates per 100 deaths from COVID-19 in Hubei and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged ≥ 60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID-19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high-risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy. Restricting hospital workers aged ≥ 60 years from direct patient care reduced counts to 1,985 (95% CI: 1,627 to 2,347) considering Hubei and to 2,002 (95% CI: 1,400 to 2,602) considering the Italian scenario. Conclusion: We estimated significant burden of illness due to COVID-19 if no strategies are adopted. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could have significant reductions in hospital worker infections.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,"the United States|US|COVID-19|PPE|secondary|US|100|COVID-19|Hubei|Italy|Monte Carlo|95%|US|two|PPE|COVID-19|30%|60 years|US|China|Italy|100|108.2|Hubei|94.1|Italy|Based on Hubei|about 53,640|US|95%|CI|43,160|62,251|COVID-19|Italian|53,097|US|95%|CI|37,133|69,003|PPE|28,100|95%|CI|23,048|33,242|Hubei|28,354|95%|CI|19,829|36,848|Italy|60 years|1,985|95%|CI|1,627|2,347|Hubei|2,002|95%|CI|1,400|2,602|Italian|COVID-19|PPE|the age of 60|INFECTIONS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS|THE UNITED STATES",10.1101/2020.04.06.20055988

As a designated hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 patients. With the COVID-19 becoming a pandemic all over the world, we aim to share our epidemiological and clinical findings with the global community. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application. Findings Baseline T lymphocyte Subsets differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in two-sample t-tests: Total T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Helper T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Suppressor T cells (p = 1.8-14), and TH/TS (Helper/Suppressor ratio, p = 0.0066). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1.05, p 0.04), underlying disease status (OR 3.42, p 0.02), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0.22, p 0.00), and TH/TS on the log scale (OR 4.80, p 0.00). The McFadden pseudo R-squared for the logistic regression model is 0.35, suggesting the model has a fair predictive power. Interpretation While age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery.

Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus.

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

The impact of the disease, while has been relatively low in the Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) so far, is expected to be devastating given the less developed and fragmented health care system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures such as border closings, cancellations of inbound flights, social distancing, and promotion of hand hygiene may not be as effective due to the clustered way people live in large as well as smaller population centers. As SSA waits for the start of large epidemics as seem in other regions, there exist acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it gets strong hold in the region. To address this need, we developed a mathematical model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, to estimate the number of infections with in the first 90 days of the transmission under different scenarios of population sizes, initial number of cases, and coverage of contact tracing and isolation. Our results show that if implemented early, 80% contact tracing may flattens the curve of local epidemics, brings the pandemic to a manageable level for all population sizes we assessed.

Methods: Here, in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data with the goals of identifying the high risk areas of disease spread and assessing the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. We compared the impact of intracity vs. intercity travel restrictions on both the total number of infections and the speed of outbreak spread and developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions. Findings: We found that intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on overall infection numbers than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. We also identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. Interpretation: In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. Both intracity and intercity movement affect outbreak dynamics, with the former having more of an impact on the total numbers of cases and the latter impacting geographic scope.

However, there were few studies about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 31 pregnant women and 35 non-pregnant women from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2020 to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Inflammatory indices were used to assess the severity of COVID-19. Evidence of vertical transmission was determined by laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Findings Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever (54.8% vs. 87.5%, p= 0.006), a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization, and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID-19 (32.3% vs. 11.4%, p=0.039). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systematic immune-inflammation-based prognostic index (SII) were significantly higher on admission in severe/critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group. We could not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Conclusions The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women were insidious and atypical, compared with those in non-pregnant patients.

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre on March 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern Madrid. During March 2020 highly active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was experienced in Madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by March 29th. Methods Since the beginning of the epidemics the Occupational Health and Safety Service (OHSS) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the Microbiology Laboratory by automatized specific PCR methods that was operative from February 25th as part of the preparedness. Results From a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 %) were tested during the period 1-29 March 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). The first HCW infected was confirmed on March 9th. A total of 791 HCW and personnel were confirmed to be infected by March 29th, representing 38% of those tested and 11,6 % of all the hospital workers. The proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between HCW and those patients attending at the Emergency Department (ER) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR detection between HCW from high risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. The curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and HCW during March 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. Discussion The recommendation from our OHSS did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of HCW and non-sanitary personnel was tested in March 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in Madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 % of the hospital employees. Most of the COVID-19 cases among the hospital HCW and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3%) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. No fatalities occurred during the study period. Although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of HCW and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. Furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (March 2020) between patients attending the ER and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. This experience is similar to the communicated from Wuhan verified by the WHO Joint Mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the Netherlands, where most of the infections of HCW were related to household or community contacts. Significance Since the collective of hospital HCW are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for SARS-CoV-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. There appears to be a close connection between HCW infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. Although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. Exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 % is a minimum estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics.

The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions.

In readiness for this challenge, Australia has drawn on clinical pathway models developed over many years in preparation for influenza pandemics. These models have been used to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients, in the context of broader public health measures. Methods An age and risk stratified transmission model of COVID-19 infection was used to simulate an unmitigated epidemic with parameter ranges reflecting uncertainty in current estimates of transmissibility and severity. Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing. Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways. Findings An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone will be insufficient to constrain case presentations within a feasible level of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions will need to be applied at some level over the course of the epidemic to ensure that systems do not become overwhelmed, and that essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed to ensure access to critical care. Interpretation Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality will rely on a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health and clinical capacity, along with reduction of overall infection transmission in the community.

We attempted to deduce a formula in order to model the number of the ICU patients in France from the official data and patient turnover in the ICU. METHODS: The Covid19 ICU patient turnover was calculated using a recurrence relation from the internal data provided by Hospices Civils de Lyon. The number of new Covid19 cases detected daily was modelized to fit with the last known data in France and extrapolated for the coming days using two scenarios following the existing data in China (best scenario) and Italy (worst scenario). The number of daily admissions in ICU was calculated as the sum of 13.7% of the new Covid19 cases detected on a given day and 7.8% of the average of the total new Covid-19 cases recorded in the last week. Approximately 39.7% of patients admitted to the ICU were non-intubated with an average ICU length of stay of 4 days. Conversely, 60.3% of patients were intubated and for those who died among them (14.44%) the ICU length of stay was of 4 days for 78.3% of them and of 15 days for 21.7% of them. For the intubated patients that were discharged alive, the ICU length of stay was of 6 days for 44.4% of them and of 20 days for 55.6% of them.

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,two|CQ|COVID-19|two|CQ|Manaus|Brazilian|Amazon|CQ|600|daily|10 days|12|CQ|450|5 days|the first day|2.7|ClinicalTrials.gov|NCT04323527|440|81|CQ|QTc>500ms|25%|17%|13.5%|95%CI=6.9-23.0%|CI|CQ|95%CI=14.5-19.2%|14|day 4|one|10-day|COVID-19|CQ|COVID-19|COVID-19|Chloroquine|two,10.1101/2020.04.07.20056424

We propose a pragmatic model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic by applying a mixture normal distribution to open accessible WHO data. We specified a simple joint model on data from 20 countries with number of confirmed COVID-19 infections and number of COVID-19 deaths. We found that the duration of an epidemic wave (99% of total size) was usually between 45-48 days. Using data up to April 6, 2020, we found in six of 20 counties two waves, spaced between 21 and 47 days. In China and Korea the first wave was bigger, and in Denmark, Iran, Japan, and Sweden the second wave was stronger. Lag time between time trends in confirmed infections and time trends in deaths varied between 3.1 and 9.5 days. We obtained a good fit between observed and modelled data in almost all countries. In about halve of the countries the highest peak of the COVID-19 epidemic had been reached until April 6, 2020. Among the 20 countries, it is predicted that the USA will reach the highest numbers of confirmed infections (653 683-802 205) and number of deaths (36 591-53 286).

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P∞ for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n→∞ we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(∞) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(∞) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-α n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-γ,2<γ<3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network).

However, on March 26th the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|March 26th|the American College of Chest Physicians|CHEST|the United States|New York|Vt|four|Vt|5|PEEP|Farkas|J.D.

Part I: Population dynamics and future spreading of infection in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the pandemic of COVID-19.,"Mobile geolocation data is a valuable asset in the assessment of movement patterns of a population. Once a highly contagious disease takes place in a location the movement patterns aid in predicting the potential spatial spreading of the disease, hence mobile data becomes a crucial tool to epidemic models. In this work, based on millions of anonymized mobile visits data in Brazil, we investigate the most probable spreading patterns of the COVID-19 within states of Brazil. The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. The first part of the study focus on the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORDINAL|GPE|PERSON|DATE|DATE|ORDINAL|ORG|NORP|GPE|PERSON|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,millions|Brazil|COVID-19|Brazil|first|Sao Paulo|Rio de Janeiro|the period of|March 2020|first|Metapopulation|Brazilian|Sao Paulo|Rio de Janeiro|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.07.20056739

Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,2014-15|two|first|second|Covid-19|Covid-19,10.1101/2020.04.07.20056754

Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics. Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0 (0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan.

It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors, which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and which raise ACE2 levels, may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods:​ We evaluated this hypothesis in an early cohort of 205 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, London, UK with the primary endpoint being death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 7-days of symptom onset. Findings:​ 53 patients out of 205 patients reached the primary endpoint. Contrary to the hypothesis, treatment with ACE-inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of rapidly deteriorating severe disease. There was a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days in patients on an ACE-inhibitor OR 0​.​29 (CI 0​.​10-0​.​75, p<0​.0​1), adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure). Interpretation:​ Although a small sample size, we do not see evidence for ACE-inhibitors increasing the short-term severity of COVID-19 disease and patients on treatment with ACE-inhibitors should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness.

Because the clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province were reported for the first time on February 13, 2020, a very high peak of new cases in China was observed. The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine. Interpretation: Some non-specific RT-PCR primers could cause the serious interference during RT-PCR amplification so as to increase the risk of false-negative diagnoses for COVID-19 infections.

To address the myriad issues generated by this pandemic, an interdisciplinary breadth of research, clinical, and public health communities have rapidly engaged to find answers and solutions. One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are possible. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. There is a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E, a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative), and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk. There are 9 case studies of human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; none detected the virus. Importantly, none of the published studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their analytical methods for use in human milk.

Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, are a risk for infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and have to communicate test results. Here, we present a secure tracking system (CTest) to report COVID-19 test results online as soon as they become available. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person but also the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. Instead of personal calls, CTest updates the status of the test automatically when the test results are available. Test reports are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks also by patients not using smartphones with dedicated mobile apps which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age.

Methods and implications for safety,"Background and Objectives: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has lead to a global decrease in protection ware, especially facepiece filtering respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of descontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light dosage varies significantly on different respirator angles, and propose a method to descontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. Methods: An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x55 x 33 cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4cm, and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. A spectrometer STN-SilverNova was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. Results: The data obtained reveal that the dosage received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the luminaires plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant in order to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Conclusion: Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance, angle of incidence of the light source. Careful dosage measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,UVGI|UVGI|69.5 x55|33|three|58 x 41 x 15 cm|Two|four|Aura|9322|17|9 x 4cm|two|17 x 6 x 5 cm|8.2|UVGI|FFR|UVGI,10.1101/2020.04.07.20057224

Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis.

The gold standard approach to detecting an active viral infection is the use of RT-qPCR. This approach requires the isolation of viral RNA from respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs. We developed a method using a widely available lysis buffer coupled with solid-phase reverse immobilization (SPRI) beads to extract viral RNA from swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) which can be performed manually or on a Hamilton STAR liquid-handling robot.

The COVID-19 outbreak results from infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. We queried whether the BCG vaccine offers protection against CoV-2 infection. We observed that countries with a current universal BCG vaccination policy have a significantly lower COVID-19 incidence than countries which never had a universal BCG policy or had one in the past. However, population density, median age, TB incidence, urban population, and, most significantly, CoV-2 testing rate, were also connected with BCG policy and could potentially confound the analysis. By limiting the analysis to countries with high CoV-2 testing rates, defined as greater than 2,500 tests per million inhabitants, these parameters were no longer statistically associated with BCG policy. When analyzing only countries with high testing rates, there was no longer a significant association between the number of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants and the BCG vaccination policy. Although preliminary, our analyses indicate that the BCG vaccination may not offer protection against CoV-2 infection. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our findings support exercising caution in determining potential correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, in part due significantly lower rates of CoV-2 testing per million inhabitants in countries with current universal BCG vaccination policy.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,"TThe Bacillus Calmette-Guerin|BCG|COVID-19|March 11th, 2020|BCG|BCG|BCG|one|BCG|2,500|million|BCG|COVID-19|million|BCG|BCG|BCG|COVID-19|million|BCG|COVID-19|BCG",10.1101/2020.04.08.20056051

Design This is the protocol of a living systematic review. Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include studies that assess patients with confirmed or suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2 and inform the relation of potential prognostic factors with death or disease severity. Two groups of two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed.

We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response (≥30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk. We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas > .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all p values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents. Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,"COVID-19|US|Twitter|Facebook|NextDoor|March 14th to March 23rd|21|LIWC|Stanford|IRB|9 days|20,734|6,573|1|18-31|32-44|32-64|65+|7,355|39.8%|18-31|52.4%|60%|1|seven|1|2|3|Social Distancing|the COVID-19 Pandemic|the United States|Implications for Public Health Messaging",10.1101/2020.04.08.20057067

It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions resulting in 651 cases. The following wave saw unexpectedly three digit number of daily cases following a mass gathering urged the government to choose a more stringent measure. A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model. Method one based on curve fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be on 19th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method two based on SIR Model estimated that the peak will be on 20th - 31st May 2020 if Movement Contro (MCO) is in place with an estimation of 630,000 to 800,000 infected persons. Method three based on System Dynamic Model estimated that the peak will be on 17th May 2020 with an estimation of 22,421 infected persons.

We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|NORP|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|COVID-19|Bayesian|PCR|Alberta|Canada|3/28/2020|Philadelphia|USA|3/31/2020|60 to 95%|95%|60-70%|hundreds|COVID-19|Bayesian|Bayesian|COVID-19|Alberta|Canada|Philadelphia|USA,10.1101/2020.04.08.20057661

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age ≥75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2).

Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic.

Health systems will need surge capacity to absorb acute increases in caseload due to the pandemic. We assessed the capacity of the Kenyan health system to absorb surges in the number of people that will need hospitalization and critical care because of the COVID-19. Methods We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. Results The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit.

Severe patients progressed rapidly to Critical condition including multi-organ failure and even death. Identification of early predictive factors is urgently necessary to facilitate appropriate intensive care. METHODS We included all patient admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital and treated by the supportive medical team of Beijing Tongren Hospital as of March 20, 2020. Indicators of injuries for multiple organs, including the heart, kidney and liver, and glucose homeostasis were specifically analyzed for predicting primary outcomes (an intensive care unit (ICU) or death). RESULTS The data of 120 patients with a severity equal to or greater than Moderate, discharged or died were extracted. After excluding patients with history of diabetes, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, 69 patients were included in the final analysis. There were 26 cases with primary outcomes including 16 deaths. Univariable analysis indicated that fasting blood glucose (FBG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), creatine kinase and creatinine were associated with primary outcomes and death. Among patients with primary outcomes, although FBG levels were much higher on admission, they dramatically decreased subsequently, while in deceased patients they increased continuously. Multivariable Cox regression indicated that FBG≥7mmol/L was the only independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.15). Cluster analysis found more proximities of FBG (at the time of admission) with LDH, HDDH or Creatinine (after 2-4 days of hospitalization) (r=0.43, 0.43 and 0.50, respectively, P<0.01 for all). Conclusions Blood glucose is a representative of the clustered indicators of multi-organ injury and earlier predictor for poor outcomes and death in the COVID patients.

A recent study of patients in China discovered an association between ABO blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by comparing COVID-19 patients with the general population. Whether blood type is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity or mortality remains unknown. We used observational healthcare data on 1559 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 (682 COV+) with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO+Rh blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status, intubation, and death. We found a higher proportion of blood group A and a lower proportion of blood group O among COV+ patients compared to COV-, though in both cases the result is significant only in Rh positive blood types. We show that the effect of blood type is not explained by risk factors we considered (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight status, and chronic cardiovascular and lung disorders). In a meta-analysis of NYP data with previously-reported data from China, we find enrichment for A and B and depletion of O blood groups among COVID-19 patients compared to the general population. Our data do not provide strong evidence of associations between blood group and intubation or death among COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary observational study of data currently being collected during the outbreak, we find new evidence of associations between B, AB, and Rh blood groups and COVID-19 and further evidence of recently-discovered associations between A and O blood groups and COVID-19.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,China|ABO|COVID-19|1559|682|the New York Presbyterian|NYP|ABO+Rh|COV+|COV-|NYP|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|AB|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.08.20058073

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those ≤19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in ≥80 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China.

Kiang,,U.S. county-level characteristics to inform equitable COVID-19 response,"The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the United States confirms that not all Americans are equally at risk of infection, severe disease, or mortality. A range of intersecting biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors are likely to determine an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19. These factors vary significantly across counties in the United States, and often reflect the structural inequities in our society. Recognizing this vast inter-county variation in risks will be critical to mounting an adequate response strategy. Using publicly available county-specific data we identified key biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors influencing susceptibility to COVID-19, guided by international experiences and consideration of epidemiological parameters of importance. We created bivariate county-level maps to summarize examples of key relationships across these categories, grouping age and poverty; comorbidities and lack of health insurance; proximity, density and bed capacity; and race and ethnicity, and premature death. We have also made available an interactive online tool that allows public health officials to query risk factors most relevant to their local context. Our data demonstrate significant inter-county variation in key epidemiological risk factors, with a clustering of counties in certain states, which will result in an increased demand on their public health system. While the East and West coast cities are particularly vulnerable owing to their densities (and travel routes), a large number of counties in the Southeastern states have a high proportion of at-risk populations, with high levels of poverty, comorbidities, and premature death at baseline, and low levels of health insurance coverage. The list of variables we have examined is by no means comprehensive, and several of them are interrelated and magnify underlying vulnerabilities. The online tool allows readers to explore additional combinations of risk factors, set categorical thresholds for each covariate, and filter counties above different population thresholds. COVID-19 responses and decision making in the United States remain decentralized. Both the federal and state governments will benefit from recognizing high intra-state, inter-county variation in population risks and response capacity. Many of the factors that are likely to exacerbate the burden of COVID-19 and the demand on healthcare systems are the compounded result of long-standing structural inequalities in US society. Strategies to protect those in the most vulnerable counties will require urgent measures to better support communities' attempts at social distancing and to accelerate cooperation across jurisdictions to supply personnel and equipment to counties that will experience high demand.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|GPE|NORP|ORG|GPE|PERSON|LOC|LOC|LOC|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|the United States|Americans|COVID-19|the United States|COVID-19|East|West|Southeastern|the United States|COVID-19|US|U.S.|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.08.20058248

Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). Conclusions: Work-related transmission is considerable in early Covid-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW.

These include the doubling time of the epidemic, i.e., the number of days until the number of cases doubles, and various representations of the number of cases over time, including the epidemic curve and associated cumulative incidence curve. While these quantities are immediately estimable given current data, they suffer from dependence on the underlying testing strategies within communities. Specifically, they are inextricably tied to the likelihood that an infected individual is tested and identified as a case. We clarify the functional relationship between testing and the epidemic parameters of interest, and thereby demonstrate simply sensitivity analyses that explore the range of possible truths under various testing scenarios.

This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7th-8th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research ques-tions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had negatively impacted the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polyno-mial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through multi-class classification models with an accuracy of 75%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks. This study will be useful for the Government of India and various states of India, Administrative Units of India, Frontline health workforce of India, researchers and scientists.

There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,millions|Corvid|the United States|three|Models|Corvid|NPI|Models|Modeling|the United States|Corvid,10.1101/2020.04.08.20058487

Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk RR(g) for the age group g to be the ratio RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio OR(g1,g2)=RR(g1)/RR(g2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group g1 vs. g2 for the later vs. early periods is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk RR(g) was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15-19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10-14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,PERSON|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|NORP|DATE|DATE|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,"Robert Koch Institute|weekly|Germany|eight 5-year age|10-14y|45-49y|10-49y|weeks 13-14, 2020|weeks|10-11, 2020|RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g|RR(g1|RR(g2|1|COVID-19|20-24y|RR=1.4(95%|CI|1.27,1.55|15-19y|RR=1.14(0.99,1.32|30-34y|1.07(0.99,1.16|25-29y|35-39y|40-44y|RR=0.9(0.83,0.98|45-49y|10-14y|RR=0.78(0.64,0.95|20-24y|1|15-19y|35y|1|15-34y|20-24y|Germany|35-49y|10-14y|15-34y|German|15-34y|20-24y|Germany",10.1101/2020.04.08.20058719

Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they contain noncanonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5′UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3′UTR, inside 5′UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Maranas,,De novo design of high-affinity antibody variable regions (scFv) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"AbstractThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the pandemic of respiratory disease known as COVID-19, which emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in late 2019. Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed ACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of “human string content” (HSC)3. We generated 60 different variable region designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low immunogenicity scores. By grafting these designed variable regions with frameworks, high-affinity monoclonal antibodies can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as neutralizing antibodies.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON,biorxiv,biorxiv,,COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|late 2019|RBD|VDJ|OptMAVEn-2.02|60|five|Rosetta,10.1101/2020.04.09.034868

Higham,,Comparative ACE2 variation and primate COVID-19 risk,"AbstractThe emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused tens of thousands of deaths and huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which have already been reduced to small and endangered populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies have shown that rhesus macaques exposed to the virus develop COVID-19-like symptoms, the susceptibility of other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys, exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival.

Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, China closed down large areas almost completely to increase social distance; South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts; and many European countries try to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and that should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population in time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available at each time point. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). Two main scenarios were tested with several variants. The first, a mitigation strategy, aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. The other, a suppression strategy, consists of the same mobility restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. Both take as their starting point the actual situation as of 2020-04-06. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30−40% mobility reduction appears able to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not to suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20−25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction during the first year of the cumulative number infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy. Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes of various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While latter are important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, the mitigation strategy aiming to slow down the epidemic mainly via social isolation appears to be a destructive policy, i.e. a policy that has, based on scientific knowledge, better alternatives. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population model and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|GPE|GPE|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|China|South Korea|European|REINA|Cython|the Helsinki University Hospital region|1.6 million|Two|first|2020-04-06|30−40%|20−25%|the first year|820 000 to 80|6000|only 640|REINA|REINA|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.09.20047498

During this week, it seems, everything changed. Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic. Our analyses also reveal perceptions of becoming infected with the virus, and dying from Covid-19, were driven upwards by a rapidly increasing national caseload, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the adaptation of social distancing were affected by both national and state-level cases.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,the week of March 10-16|Covid-19|U.S.|this week|the United States|U.S.|Covid-19|U.S.|mid-March 2020|the next months|Covid-19|two|the United States|Covid-19|Covid-19|the United States,10.1101/2020.04.09.20049288

It took about 2 months for China to get this infectious disease under control in its epicenter at Wuhan. Since February 2020, COVID-19 has been spreading around the world, becoming widespread in a number of countries. The timing and nature of government actions in response to the pandemic has varied from country to country, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. Method: The present study proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model to perform a comparative analysis of the temporal progress of disease spread in six regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). For each region we developed detailed timelines of reported infections and outcomes, along with government-implemented measures to enforce social distancing. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Results: The main results of this study are as follows: (a) an empirical COVID-19 growth law provides an excellent fit to the disease data in all study regions and potentially could be of more general validity; (b) significant differences exist in the spread characteristics of the disease among the three regions of China and between the three regions of China and the three countries; (c) under the control measures implemented in the Chinese regions (including the immediate quarantine of infected patients and their close contacts, and considerable restrictions on social contacts), the transmission rate of COVID-19 followed a modified normal distribution function, and it reached its peak after 1 to 2 days and then was reduced to zero 11, 11 and 18 days after a 1st-Level Response to Major Public Health Emergency was declared in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang, respectively; moreover, the epidemic control times in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang showed that the epidemic reached an inflection point after 9, 12 and 17 days, respectively, after a 1st-Level Response was issued; (d) an empirical COVID-19 law provided an excellent fit to the disease data in the six study regions, and the law can be potentially of more general validity; and (e) the curves of infected cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been significantly flattened and shrunken at a relatively earlier stage of the epidemic if similar preventive measures as in the Chinese regions had been also taken in the above three countries on February 25th, February 25th and March 8th, respectively: the simulated maximum number of infected individuals in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been 4480 cases (March 9th, 2020), 2335 cases (March 10th) and 6969 cases (March 20th), instead of the actual (reported) numbers of 7212 cases (March 9th), 8514 cases (March 10th, 2020) and 11466 cases (March 20th), respectively; moreover, up to March 29th, the simulated reduction in the accumulated number of infected cases would be 1585 for South Korea, 93490 for Italy and 23213 for Iran, respectively, accounting for 16.41% (South Korea), 95.70% (Italy) and 60.59% (Iran) of the accumulated number of actual reported infected cases. Conclusions: The implemented measures in China were very effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. These measures should be taken as early as possible, including the early identification of all infection sources and eliminating transmission pathways. Subsequently, the number of infected cases can be controlled at a low level, and existing medical resources could be sufficient for maintaining higher cure rates and lower mortality rate compared to the current situations in these countries. The proposed model can account for these prevention and control measures by properly adjusting its parameters, it computes the corresponding variations in disease transmission rate during the outbreak period, and it can provide valuable information for public health decision-making purposes.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|QUANTITY|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,"Coronavirus|2019|January 2020|Wuhan|Hubei|China|about 2 months|China|Wuhan|February 2020|COVID-19|Method|SEIR|six|three|Chinese|Zhejiang|Guangdong|Xinjiang|three|South Korea|Italy|Iran|COVID-19|three|three|China|three|China|three|Chinese|COVID-19|1 to 2 days|zero|11|11|18 days|1st-Level Response|Major Public Health Emergency|Zhejiang|Guangdong|Xinjiang|Zhejiang|Guangdong|Xinjiang|9|12|17 days|six|South Korea|Italy|Iran|Chinese|three|February 25th, February 25th and March 8th|South Korea|Italy|Iran|4480|March 9th, 2020|2335|March 10th|6969|March 20th|7212|March 9th|March 10th, 2020|March 20th|up to March 29th|1585|South Korea|93490|Italy|23213|Iran|16.41%|South Korea|95.70%|Italy|60.59%|Iran|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|Three|Chinese|Regions|South Korea|Italy|Iran",10.1101/2020.04.09.20053223

We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and, if so, estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases in a large database of primary-care records covering >6 million people in Catalonia. Design: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, using all influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020. Setting: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. Participants: People registered in one of the contributing primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population. Main outcome measures: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 diagnosed in primary care. Analyses: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model predictions for 2019-2020. ARIMA models were fitted to the included influenza seasons, overall and stratified by age, to estimate expected case numbers. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. Results: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 20202, 8,017 (95% CI: 1,841 to 14,718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group. Conclusions: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. In future, the surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like illness-causing pathogens.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a desperate need for therapy against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Chloroquine is one proposed medication that has received substantial public attention. However, drug labeling in the package insertion states that persons with epilepsy have the risk of chloroquine provoking seizures, and this has increased questions and anxiety in the epilepsy community. Methods: PubMed (1970 to March 27, 2020) and the Embase (1970 to March 27, 2020) were searched with the terms chloroquine and seizure or epilepsy. Selected studies were reviewed, and the adverse drug reaction was classified. Results: Only nine out of 27 studies were deemed eligible for systematic analysis. Out of the nine studies, only one was a prospective study (N=109), two were case series (N=6), and the remaining 6 were case reports. The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient, the seizure was after taking 1000 mg. The strength of causality for the drug causing seizures in healthy and persons with epilepsy was mostly possible or unlikely, and none were certain. The only clinical trial that evaluated seizure risk with chloroquine failed to find any significant relation. Conclusion: Although the drug insertion label states an increased risk of seizure, the systematic review highlights that such a statement is not supported by any class I studies but by anecdotal case reports. The only randomized clinical study revealed that seizures were not associated with an increased blood level of chloroquine or its metabolite. The present systematic review should provide reassurance to busy clinicians and persons with epilepsy that chloroquine, if prescribed to treat COVID-19, lacks any substantial evidence to suggest that the medication increases the risk of seizure.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON,medrxiv,medrvix,,"COVID-19|Chloroquine|PubMed|1970 to March 27, 2020|1970 to March 27, 2020|Only nine|27|nine|only one|N=109|two|6|between 100-500|one|1000|COVID-19",10.1101/2020.04.09.20056358

This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals performance. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (≥1500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. Conclusions: During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals.

The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care. Methods We obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries. Results Kenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase. Conclusion The 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north. Radical population-level physical distancing measures may be required, but their impact on poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people and communities need mitigating.

Analytical risk assessment is a valuable approach to guide decision-making on travel restrictions and border measures during the early phase of an outbreak, when transmission is primarily contained within a source country. Here we introduce a modular framework for estimating the importation risk of an emerging disease when the direct travel route is restricted and the risk stems from indirect importation via intermediary countries. This was the situation for Australia in February 2020. The framework was specifically developed to assess the importation risk of COVID-19 into Australia during the early stages of the outbreak from late January to mid-February 2020. The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. However, with travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China into Australia via potential intermediary countries in the Asia Pacific region. The framework was successfully used to contribute to the evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions in the Australian context during the early phase of COVID-19 emergence and is adaptable to other contexts for future outbreak response.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|LOC|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,Australia|February 2020|COVID-19|Australia|late January|mid-February 2020|Australia|China|China|Australia|February 1|China|Australia|the Asia Pacific region|Australian|COVID-19|COVID-19|the Asia Pacificregion,10.1101/2020.04.09.20057257

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to four weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. 18147 individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Respondents endorsing PTSS, depression, anxiety, insomnia, high perceived stress and adjustment disorder were 6604 (37%), 3084 (17.3%), 3700 (20.8%), 1301 (7.3%), 3895 (21.8%) and 4092 (22.9%), respectively. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress and insomnia.

Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa (κ). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC (κ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (κ = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings.

Methods: The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively.

While developed countries such as the USA, Italy, England, France, Spain, and Germany struggle to mitigate the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Latin America, India, and Africa -territories in which the mounted infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly underdeveloped. An actual epidemic emergency does not provide the required timeframe for testing new diagnostic strategies; therefore, the first line of response must be based on commercially and readily available resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using a set of in-house designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2 X 105 DNA copies by this straightforward method. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for use during the COVID-19 pandemics, particularly in underdeveloped regions were the availability of RT-qPCR instruments may be limited.

Besides, it is unclear how stable the COVID-19 virus is under dry and wet conditions. In the present study, we have shown that the COVID-19 virus is extremely infectious as manifested by the infection of Vero-E6 cells by one PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) of the virus. We then investigated the stability of the COVID-19 virus in wet, dry and acidic (pH2.2) environments at room temperature. Results showed that the COVID-19 virus could survive for three days in wet and dry environments, but the dry condition is less favorable for the survival of the virus. Our study also demonstrated that the COVID-19 virus at a relative high titer (1.2 x 103 PFU) exhibits a certain degree of tolerance to acidic environment at least for 60 minutes. When the virus titer was ≤1.0 x 103 PFU, acid treatment (pH2.2) for 30 or 60 minute resulted in virus inactivation. It suggests that the virus at a high concentration may survive in the acidic environment of the stomach. The finding of the present study will contribute to the control of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|ORG|DATE|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|TIME|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|TIME,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|Vero-E6|one|Plaque Forming Unit|COVID-19|COVID-19|three days|1.2 x|103|60 minutes|103|30|60 minute,10.1101/2020.04.09.20058875

We aimed to bridge the gap between disease classification and clinical outcome in intensive care patients, data of which are scarce and such classification could help in individual evaluation and provide effective triage for treatment and management. Specifically, we collected and filtered out 151 intensive care patients with complete medical records from Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China. We constructed a fully Bayesian latent variable model for integrative clustering of six data categories, including demographic information, symptoms, original comorbidities, vital signs, blood routine tests and inflammatory marker measurements. We identified four prognostic types of COVID-19 in intensive care patients, presenting a stepwise distribution in age, respiratory condition and inflammatory markers, suggesting the prognostic efficacy of these indicators. This report, to our knowledge, is the first attempt of dealing with classification of COVID-19 in intensive care patients. We acknowledge the limitation of ignoring the effect of treatment, but we believe such classification is enlightening for better triage, allowing for a more rational allocation of scarce medical resources in a resource constrained environment.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|151|Tongji|Wuhan|China|Bayesian|six|four|first|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.09.20058909

Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders.

Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading. We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China. The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one.

A model-based estimation,"Background and Rationale: Amid SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the low number of infections for a population size of 1.38 billion is widely discussed, but with no definite answers. Methods: We used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records. The infection fatality rates were taken from Verity et al (2020). Age distribution of the population for India and states are taken from the Census of India (2011). Reported number of deaths and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases from https://www.covid19india.org. The reported numbers of samples tests were collected from the reports of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). Results: The findings suggest that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections with a huge variation across its states. Among 13 states which have more than 100 COVID-19 cases, the detection rate varies from 81.9% (of 410 estimated infections) in Kerala to 0.8% (of 35487 estimated infections) in Madhya Pradesh and 2.4% (of 7431 estimated infections) in Gujarat. Conclusion: As the study reports a lower number of deaths and higher recovery rates in the states with a high detection rate, thus suggest that India must enhance its testing capacity and go for widespread testing. Late detection puts patients in greater need of mechanical ventilation and ICU care, which imposes greater costs on the health system.

We modeled the Covid19 outbreak in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire Chinese epidemiological dynamics. We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified auto-encoder with Covid19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible/exposed/infected/removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a one month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions. According to our model, total confirmed cases in all Italy regions could reach 160,000 cases by April 30th and stabilize at a plateau. Conclusions.

We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak.

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the region was reported on February 14, but what lies ahead in terms of the course and magnitude of infection remains speculative. To the best of our knowledge, no study, using a robust methodology, provides the immediate and long-term trajectory of COVID-19 for the entire region or accounts for its local context. This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide estimates on how many people would contract the virus and how many would die in the coming few months across Africa. Methods: The forecasts on caseloads and incidences are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were further applied to generate mortality estimates after adjustments were made for differences in age-structure, health service quality, and living standards between each of the African countries and those of the reference population. We cover all countries that reported a confirmed case as of March 31, 2020. Results: By the end of June, 16,283,085 people will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98, 358, 799). With a cumulative caseload of 5,413,4517 (95% CI 1,332,953 to 8,489,940) and 906,625 (95% CI 173, 821 to 4,742,917) Northern and Eastern Africa will respectively be the most and least affected sub-regions in the continent. Cumulative COVID-19 cases on June 30, 2020 are expected to reach 2,912, 864 (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2,787, 913 (95% CI 517, 489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1,185,742 (95% CI 229, 111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. New infections (incidence) for the month of April are expected to be the highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco 1045 (95% CI 167 to 6,547) will register the highest number of deaths. Conclusion: Our study shows that countries that are least urbanized and have a low level of socio-economic development, hence least connected to the outside world, are likely to register lower and slower transmissions, at least at the early stage of the epidemic.

The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India.

As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.

Within Europe, the first countries to be strongly affected have been Italy and Spain. In Spain, infection has expanded in highly populated areas, resulting in one of the largest nationwide bursts so far by early April. We analyze the evolution of the growth curve of the epidemic in both the whole of Spain and Madrid Autonomous Region (the second largest conurbation in Europe), based on the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths. We conducted segmented, linear regressions on log-transformed data to identify changes in the slope of these curves and/or sudden shifts in the number of cases (i.e. changes in the intercept) at fitted breaking points, and compared their results with a timeline including both key events of the epidemic and containment measures taken by the national and regional governments. Results were largely consistent in the four curves analyzed (reported infections and deaths for Spain and Madrid, respectively), showing two major shifts in slopes (growth rates) at 14-15 and 26-29 March that resulted in 37-65% reductions of slope, and originated in infection on 4-5 and 16-18 March (for case detections) and 14-23 February and 5-6 March (for deaths). Small upward shifts in the progress of the disease in Madrid were not associated with significant changes in the intercept of the curve, and seem related with unevenness in case reporting. These results evidence an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19 coinciding with personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, as well as the general awareness of the population; and a second, stronger decrease when harder isolation measures were enforced. The combination of both breakpoints seemingly led to the start of the contention of the disease outbreak by early April, the limit of our time series. This highlights the importance of adopting public health strategies that include disseminating basic knowledge on personal hygiene and reduced social contact at the onset of the epidemic, and the importance of early enforcement of hard contention measures for its subsequent contention.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORDINAL|GPE|LOC|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|PERSON|ORDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,first|China|Europe|first|Italy|Spain|Spain|one|early April|Spain|Madrid Autonomous Region|second|Europe|four|Spain|Madrid|two|14-15|26-29 March|37-65%|4|16-18 March|14-23 February|5-6 March|Madrid|COVID-19|second|early April|COVID-19|Spain,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059345

The accuracy of early diagnosis is critical in the control of the spread of the virus. Although the real-time RT-PCR detection of the virus nucleic acid is the current golden diagnostic standard, it has high false negative rate when only apply single test. Objective Summarize the baseline characteristics and laboratory examination results of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analyze the factors that could interfere with the early diagnosis quantitatively to support the timely confirmation of the disease. Methods All suspected patients with COVID-19 were included in our study until Feb 9th, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 20th, 2020. Throat swab real-time RT-PCR test was used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the potential diagnostic value in factors, which had statistical differences in regression analysis. Results In total, 315 hospitalized patients were included. Among them, 108 were confirmed as COVID-19 patients and 207 were non-COVID-19 patients. Two groups of patients have significance in comparing age, contact history, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p<0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively. Taking chest CT scan diagnosis together with patients age and decreasing lymphocytes, AUC would be 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The age threshold to predict COVID-19 was 41.5 years, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) and a specificity of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.71 and 0.50, respectively. Threshold of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19 was 1.53x109/L, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.88) and a specificity of 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.64 and 0.37, respectively. Conclusion Single RT-PCR test has relatively high false negative rate.

Knowledge of random testing outcomes will therefore (i) significantly improve the predictability of the course of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates (such as new tracing strategies based on the mobile telephone network, wearing face masks, etc.). Frequent random testing for COVID-19 infections has the essential benefit of providing more reliable and refined data than currently available, in both time and space. This is crucial to accompany and monitor the safe release of restrictive measures. Here we show that independent of the total size of population with frequent interactions among its members, about 15000 tests with randomly selected people per day suffice to obtain valuable data about the current number of infections and their evolution in time. In contrast to testing confined to particular subpopulations such as those displaying symptoms, this will allow close to real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. With yet higher testing capacity, random testing further allows detection of geographical differences in spreading rates and thus the formulation of optimal strategies for a safe reboot of the economy. Most importantly, with daily random testing in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a reboot without such polling.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|COVID-19|about 15000|daily|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059360

For the ongoing SARS-COV-2 epidemic, with no previous population exposure, alternative prediction methods less reliant on assumptions may prove more effective in the near-term. We present three methods used to provide early estimates of likely SARS-COV-2 epidemic progression. During the first stage of the epidemic, growth rate charts revealed the UK, Italy and Spain as outliers, with differentially increasing growth of deaths over cases. A novel data-driven time-series model was then used to near-cast 7-day future cases and deaths with much greater precision. Finally, an epidemio-statistical model was used to bridge from near-casting to forecasting the future course of the global epidemic. By applying multiple approaches to global SARS-COV-2 data, coupled with mixed-effects methods, countries further ahead in the epidemic provide valuable information for those behind.

For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half.

The catastrophic socio-economic impacts of this intervention could outweigh its benefits if the timing and duration of implementation are left uncontrolled and ill-strategized. Here we investigate the dynamics of social distancing on age-stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital and ICU beds. Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent social-to-no-distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ~80% reduction in healthcare demands; beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.

We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit mechanisms by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics developed independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity accounts for the observed delays across different regions. Analogous arguments would apply to the international borders. We also show how disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post-lockdown effects.

Knight,,Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as markers of disease severity in COVID-19,"In severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), viral pneumonia progresses to respiratory failure. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n=50 patients, n=84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro.

Results: We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost-benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantine contacts of the infected. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown of workplaces.

Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the impact of age-specific under-reporting on between-country variability in CFR, and apparent size of COVID-19 epidemics. Design: Post-hoc secondary data analysis (case studies), and mathematical modeling. Setting: China, global. Interventions: None. Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and CFR for COVID-19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates. Results: SMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt). Limitations: Secondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR.

Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO′s shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO′s shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|WORK_OF_ART|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|RO|RO SBRT|first|15|CBCT|RO′s|RO|Likert|Remote RO|SBRT|14/15|3|8.74|8.51min|RO′s|4.5|RO|RO SBRT|RT|COVID-19|SBRT|COVID-19|Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process|the Coronavirus Pandemic,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059857

Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORDINAL|PERSON|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|DATE|NORP|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|NORP|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,"first|COVID-19|Kenya|March 13th, 2020|COVID-19|Kenya|China|China|Kenya|Kenya|KenyaCoV.|Kenyan|2019|Kenyan|Kenya|COVID-19|Kenyan|Chinese|Kenya|Kenya|1.78|95%|CI|1.44|3.46|95%|CI|2.81-4.17|80%|six months|COVID-19|Kenya",10.1101/2020.04.09.20059865

It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before.

Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46).

Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment.

We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17th and 18th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%+ ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts decisions were the most important predictors. For COVID-19 vaccination, education in HCWs should be taken as a priority, and further benefits of its recommendation to the general public will also be anticipated.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,2019|352|189|March 17th and 18th 2020|26|Chinese|Coronavirus-2|76.4%|72.5%|COVID-19|65.3%|55.7%|7|3|3|1|4.367|3.721|3.069|2.612|summer|0.398|0.339|0.414|0.353|2.076|1.776|30%+|COVID-19|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.09.20060103

The disease was first identified as a cluster of respiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread across the globe to greater than 200 countries. Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. The rapid worldwide spread of high numbers of COVID-19 cases has facilitated the need for a substantial supply of PPE that is largely unavailable in many settings, thereby creating critical shortages. Creative solutions for the decontamination and safe reuse of PPE to protect our frontline healthcare personnel are essential. Here, we describe the development of a process that began in late February 2020 for selecting and implementing the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) as viable method to reprocess N95 respirators. Since pre-existing HPV decontamination chambers were not available, we optimized the sterilization process in an operating room after experiencing initial challenges in other environments. Details are provided about the prioritization and implementation of processes for collection and storage, pre-processing, HPV decontamination, and post-processing of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Important lessons learned from this experience include, developing an adequate reserve of PPE for effective reprocessing and distribution, and identifying a suitable location with optimal environmental controls (i.e., operating room).

This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution on COVID-19 across China. Methods: In this study, we obtained confirmed cases of COVID-19, the data of airborne ambient PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ≤ 10 μm (PM10), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results. Results: During the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 μg/m3 increase in concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days. The estimated RRs of which were 1.64 (95% CIs: 1.47, 1.82) and 1.47 (95% CIs: 1.34, 1.61) with each 10 μg/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of PM2.5 on daily confirmed cases were greater than PM10 in all included lag days.

There is evidence that homologous recombination contributed to this cross-species transmission. Since that time the virus has demonstrated a high propensity for human-to-human transmission. Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K/G204R) due to three adjacent nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SAS-CoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population.

It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses. Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG,biorxiv,biorxiv,,2|2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|IgG Fc|RBD-Fc|D30E|740|615|RBD-Fc,10.1101/2020.04.10.032342

We performed genome-wide screens in human cells with chloroquine and several other widely used cationic amphipathic drugs (CADs) including the anti-depressants, sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac), the analgesic nortriptyline (Pamelor), the anti-arrhythmic amiodarone (Cordarone), and the anti-hypertensive verapamil (Calan) to characterize their molecular similarities and differences. Despite CADs having different disease indications but consistent with them sharing key chemical properties, we found CADs to have remarkably similar phenotypic profiles compared with non-CADs we and others have previously screened. The most significant genetic interaction for all CADs was the initiating step in sphingolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). A comparison of genome-wide screens performed with diverse pathogens from viruses, bacteria, plants, and parasites including Ebola, adeno-associated virus AAV2, HIV, Rotavirus, Influenza A, Zika virus, Picornavirus, Exotoxin A, Cholera toxin, Type III secretion system and Shiga toxin, Ricin toxin, and Toxoplasma gondii showed SPT as a top common host factor and 80% overlap overall in top hits specifically with CADs. Potential sphingolipid-mediated mechanisms for the host response- and virulence-modulating effects of CADs involve autophagy and SERPINE1/PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Chloroquine has recently shown potential as an anti-viral agent for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease. Our study demonstrates that numerous readily available drugs molecularly function highly similar to chloroquine, which suggests they might be considered for further pre-clinical investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene.

After target recognition and Cas mediated cleavage of biotinylated ssDNA probe molecules, the probe molecules are bound to magnetic particles. A complimentary ssDNA oligonucleotide quantum dot conjugate is then added, which only hybridizes to un-cleaved probes on the magnetic beads. After separation of hybridized from unhybridized quantum dot conjugates by magnetic sequestration, the signal is measured fluorometrically to provide a signal proportional to the cleaved probes and therefore the amount of target nucleic acid. To demonstrate the power of this assay, a 250 bp DNA target sequence matching a portion of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome is used and a detection limit of ~0.5 nM is achieved without target amplification using a simple portable ultraviolet flashlight. The positive samples are readily confirmed by visual inspection, completely avoiding the need for complicated devices and instruments.

In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes.

The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or second waves are likely. We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i.e. susceptible) population for seven European countries - to estimate immunity levels following this first wave. We compare these numbers to the total population sizes of these countries, in order to investigate the potential for future peaks. Methods: We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. Using for all countries, with a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland. Conclusion: Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity. This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely.

Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, exceptions exist to this observation, further thorough examinations are thus needed for their confirmation. In this study, therefore, we used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant.

Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients' individual respiratory system mechanics. In this study we used two simple hand-manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure-controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung's tidal volume and compliance. Compliances and volumes were measured both with the ventilator and external sensors corresponded well. However, tidal volumes measured via the ventilator were smaller compared to the tidal volumes measured via the external sensors with an absolute error of 5.3 +/- 2.5%. The tidal volumes of the individual artificial lungs were distributed in proportion to the compliances and did not differ relevantly when both artificial lungs were connected to when one was disconnected. We conclude that in case of emergency, ventilation of two patients with one ventilator requires two simple hand-crafted tubes as adaptors and available standard breathing circuit components. In such a setting, respiratory system mechanics and tidal volume of each individual patient can be reliably measured during short term clamping of the tracheal tube of the respective other patient.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|MONEY|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,more than one|two|two|one|one|5.3 +|2.5%|one|two|one|two|Resources Are Scarce - Feasibility of Emergency Ventilation|Two|One,10.1101/2020.04.10.20060525

Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 were assigned to SOC alone (control group). Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was the 28-day negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. The assessed secondary endpoints were negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21, the improvement rate of clinical symptoms within 28-day, normalization of C-reactive protein and blood lymphocyte count within 28-day. Primary and secondary analysis was by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population. Results The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different between SOC plus HCQ and SOC group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus 81.3%, P=0.341). Negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms alleviation rate was observed between the two groups. A significant efficacy of HCQ on alleviating symptoms was observed when the confounding effects of anti-viral agents were removed in the post-hoc analysis (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3). This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of SOC and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea (10%). Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than SOC alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects. Adverse events were significantly increased in HCQ recipients but no apparently increase of serious adverse events.

We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find remarkable declines in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: -29 % with 95% confidence interval -44% to -13%), ozone (O3: -11%; -20% to -2%) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: -9%; -28% to 10%) during the first two weeks of lockdown (n = 27 countries). These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to NO2. Pollutant anomalies were related to short-term health outcomes using empirical exposure-response functions. We estimate that there was a net total of 7400 (340 to 14600) premature deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided during two weeks post-lockdown. In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related avoided premature mortality was 1400 (1100 to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively. Assuming that the lockdown-induced deviations in pollutant concentrations are maintained for the duration of 2020, we estimate 0.78 (0.09 to 1.5) million premature deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric asthma cases could be avoided globally.

Bokharaie,,A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19,"The SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information. In this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|one|this day|COVID-19|A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies|Spread,10.1101/2020.04.10.20060681

In this paper, we compare outcomes for two northern Italian regions which had almost simultaneous initial outbreaks: Lombardy, which had a patient-centered approach that relied on primary care physicians and hospital care, and Veneto, which focused on community-based diagnosis and care. Methods We used numerator and denominator data from public Italian government sources to calculate reported rates of COVID-19 testing/1000, COVID-19 cases/100,000 overall and for health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs, deaths per 100,000, and the percent of cases admitted to hospitals and ICUs for February 24-April 1, 2020. Results As of April 1, 2020, Lombardy experienced 44,733 cases and 7,539 deaths; for Veneto, the corresponding values were 9,625 and 499. The cumulative case rate was 445/100,000 for Lombardy and 196/100,000 for Veneto, a 2.3-fold difference. Mortality rates were 7.5 times higher in Lombardy than in Veneto (75/100,000 and 10/100,000, respectively). Cumulative rates of testing were nearly twice as high in Veneto and were 2.7 times higher in the first week of the epidemic. In Lombardy, 51.5% of patients were admitted, including, 5.2% to intensive care units; for Veneto, the corresponding figures were 25.1% and 4.3%, respectively. HCWs account for 14.3% of all cases in Lombardy compared with 4.4% in Veneto. In Lombardy, the rate among HCWs was 19.1 times higher than in the general population (6,924 versus 362 per 100,000), while in Veneto it was 3.9 times higher (676 versus 172/100,000). Discussion The community-based approach in Veneto appears to be associated with substantially reduced rates of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and infection in HCWs compared with the patient-centered approach in Lombardy.

The fast and relentless spread nCOVID-19 has basically segmented the populace only into merely into three classes, such as susceptible, infected and recovered compartments. Adapting the classical SEIR- type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. The creators initially determined the parameters of the model from the accessible day by day information for Indian States dependent on around 35 days history of diseases, recuperation and deaths. The determined parameters have been amassed to extend future patterns for the Indian subcontinent, which is right now at a beginning time in the contamination cycle. The novelty of the study lies in the prediction of both the pessimistic and optimistic mathematical model based comprehensive analysis of nCOVID-19 infection spreading, for two different conditions: (a) if lock down gets withdrawn and (b) if lock down continues as a whole. If the complete lock down in India is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent , suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution.

Parolari,,Global convergence of COVID-19 basic reproduction number and estimation from early-time SIR dynamics,"The SIR ('susceptible-infectious-recovered') formulation is used to uncover the generic spread mechanisms observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number Ro. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled Ro=4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of Ro=2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled Ro are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in Ro > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in Ro from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%.

Whether regional variations in social vulnerability to disasters influence COVID-19 outcomes and incidence in the U.S. is unknown. Objective: To examine the association of Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of county-level social vulnerability to disasters, and its sub-components (socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, and housing type/transportation accessibility) with the case fatality rate (CFR) and incidence of COVID-19. Design: Ecological study of counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 4th, 2020. Generalized linear mixed-effects models with state-level clustering were applied to estimate county-level associations of overall SVI and its sub-component scores with COVID-19 CFR (deaths/100 cases) and incidence (cases/1000 population), adjusting for population percentage aged >65 years, and for comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score. Counties with high SVI (≥median) and high CFR (≥median) were identified. Setting: Population-based study of U.S. county-level data. Participants: U.S. counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 CFR and incidence. Results: Data from 433 counties including 283,256 cases and 6,644 deaths were analyzed. Median SVI was 0.46 [Range: 0.01-1.00], and median CFR and incidence were 1.9% [Range: 0-13.3] and 1.2 per 1000 people [Range: 0.6-38.8], respectively. Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was associated with higher CFR (RR: 1.19 [1.05, 1.34], p=0.005, per-1% increase), an association that strengthened after adjustment for age>65 years and comorbidities (RR: 1.63 [1.38, 1.91], p<0.001), and was further confirmed in a sensitivity analysis limited to six states with the highest testing levels. Although the association between overall SVI and COVID-19 incidence was not significant, the SVI sub-components of socioeconomic status and minority status were both predictors of higher incidence and CFR. A combination of high SVI (≥0.46) and high adjusted CFR (≥2.3%) was observed in 28.9% of counties. Conclusions and Relevance: Social vulnerability is associated with higher COVID-19 case fatality. High social vulnerability and CFR coexist in more than 1 in 4 U.S. counties. These counties should be targeted by public policy interventions to help alleviate the pandemic burden on the most vulnerable population.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|NORP|ORG|NORP|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|MONEY|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,"COVID-19|U.S.|Social Vulnerability|SVI|CFR|COVID-19|at least 50|April 4th, 2020|Generalized|SVI|COVID-19 CFR|cases/1000|65 years|Hierarchical Condition Category|HCC|SVI|≥median|CFR|≥median|U.S.|U.S.|at least 50|433|283,256|6,644|SVI|0.46|Range|0.01-1.00|CFR|1.9%|0|1.2|1000|0.6-38.8|CFR|RR|1.19|1.05|1.34|p=0.005|per-1%|age>65|years|RR|1.63|1.38|1.91|p<0.001|six|SVI|COVID-19|SVI|CFR|SVI (≥0.46|CFR|≥2.3%|28.9%|more than 1|4|U.S.|COVID-19 Incidence|Outcomes|the United States",10.1101/2020.04.10.20060962

Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams. Methods: In this Case-control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID-19 cases. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and predicts if that suspect case is likely to be positive (having SARS-CoV-2) or negative(not having SARS-CoV-2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focussing on using simple blood exams, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, only 81 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on this data, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining which patients were more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 when visiting an ER and that were categorized as a suspect case by medical professionals. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity. Findings: We identified that our framework achieved an average specificity of 92.16% [95% CI 91.73 - 92.59] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.29% [95% CI 94.65% - 95.90%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low-cost system to triage suspected patients at ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 63.98% [95% CI 59.82% - 67.50%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.00% [95% CI 44.88% - 51.56%]. An error analysis identified that, on average, 45% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway, thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, partially mitigating the fact that the test is not high-sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER-CoV is publicly available at https://github.com/soares-f/ER-CoV. Interpretation: Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspected patients arriving at emergency rooms, we envision that this framework can play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.

Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale.

Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time.

Approximately 54% of the cases were women. The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 3 months to 88 years), with 78% of patients aged 49 or younger. About 66% (n = 171) of patients were overseas tourists (20%) and Vietnamese students or workers returning from overseas (46%). Approximately 57% (n = 144) of patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. There have been no mortality. The reproduction ratio was estimated to range between 0.95 and 1.24. Conclusion. These data indicate that a majority of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam was imported cases in overseas tourists and young students and workers who had returned from overseas.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|NORP|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|Vietnam|Vietnam|COVID-19|Johns Hopkins University Dashboard|Demographic|each day|23/1/2020 to 10/4/2020|Vietnam|257|COVID-19|Approximately 54%|30 years|3 months to 88 years|78%|49|About 66%|171|20%|Vietnamese|46%|Approximately 57%|144|between 0.95 and 1.24|Vietnam|COVID-19|Vietnam,10.1101/2020.04.10.20061226

DESIGN: Qualitative study comprising five focus groups carried out online during the early stages of the UK's social distancing and isolation measures (5-12 days post lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. RESULTS: The social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had having substantial negative impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of the UK public within a short time of policy implementation. It has disproportionately negatively affected those in low-paid or precarious employment. Practical social and economic losses - the loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine - led to psychological and emotional 'losses' - the loss of motivation, loss of meaning, and loss of self-worth. Participants reported high adherence to distancing and isolation guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others. A central concern for participants was the uncertainty duration of the measures, and their ability to cope longer-term. Some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Initial high levels of support for, and adherence to, social distancing and isolation is likely to wane over time, particularly where end dates are uncertain. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,UK|COVID-19|five|UK|5-12 days|27|UK|18 years|COVID-19|UK|CONCLUSIONS|COVID-19|UK,10.1101/2020.04.10.20061267

Reusable elastomeric respirators are suitable alternatives when used with compatible filters. These filters may be difficult to source and elastomeric respirators are not recommended for surgical use as the exhaled air is not filtered. Breathing system filters are routinely used in anaesthetic circuits to filter virus and bacteria. In this study, we designed 3D printed adapters that allowed elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters and made simple modifications to the respirators to filter exhaled breaths. We then evaluated the performance and safety of our modified elastomeric respirators with quantitative fit tests. We recruited 8 volunteers to perform quantitative fit tests. Fit factors, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after wearing the modified respirators for 1 hour. All 8 volunteers obtained fit factors of 200+, the maximum achievable, for all tests exercises in all fit tests. The mean (range) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (3.9-5.5) kPa and 4.6 (range 4.1-5.3) kPa before and after 1 hour of usage. The mean (range) respiratory rate was 16.5 (11-24) min-1 and 17.4 (15-22) min-1 before and after 1 hour of usage. Four (50%) did not experience any subjective discomfort while 2 (25%) reported pressure on the face, 1 (12.5%) reported exhalation resistance and 1 (12.5%) reported transient dizziness with exertion.

In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|the next several months|three|COVID-19,10.1101/2020.04.10.20061325

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database. Materials and Methods: We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model. Results: We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|LOC|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG,medrxiv,medrvix,,"early April 2020|2019|COVID-19|the United States|Europe|AE|between the fourth quarter of 2012|the fourth quarter of 2019|ROR|2,389,474|520|AE|95%|ROR|1|ROR|AE|COVID-19|Neuropsychiatric|FAERS",10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358

The impact of this trait on the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts is currently unclear. We hypothesize that in populations with ORC, the formation, in groups, of a protective barrier of only recovered adults, prevents the transmission of this type of pathogens to the new susceptible hosts (i.e. young animals), thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out. We implement a spatially implicit individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of host and pathogen traits and show that the epidemic fade-out probability is consistently higher in populations with ORC, especially when disease spread is fast (high basic reproduction number R0). We also show that ORC can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of disease risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits.

The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive. Methods: Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. Results: A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (≥60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission.

Methods: All close contacts of the patient were screened since the first supermarket employee with COVID-19 was identified. A retrospective analysis was made on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the confirmed cases admitted to the designated hospitals for centralized treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to the first generation (supermarket employees, group A) and the second or third generation (family members or friends of supermarket employees, group B), and the similarities and differences between the two groups were compared. Results: A total of 24 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed, with an average age of 48±1.73 years. The mean duration from onset to release form quarantine was 21.04±6.77 days, and the onset time was concentrated in 5-11 days after the first patient was diagnosed. Among all the patients, 23 patients were moderate, among which 7 patients (29.17%) were asymptomatic. Symptoms of symptomatic patients were cough (75.00%), low fever (62.50%), shortness of breath (41.67%), sore throat (25.00%), gastrointestinal symptoms (25.00%), fatigue (20.83%), etc. Biochemical examination on admission showed that the white blood cell count < 4.010×9/L (29.17%) and the lymphocyte count <1.1×109/L (58.33%). The lymphocyte count of 50.00% of the patients was ≤0.6×109/L. On admission, chest CT showed pneumonia (100%) with bilateral infiltration (75.00%). Treatment: antiviral drug (100%), Chinese medicine (100%), common oxygen therapy (45.83%). There were 11 cases in group A (first generation, 11 cases) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases). In group B, there were more males, from onset to admission later, more patients had underlying diseases, and more patients were treated with albumin (P<0.05). However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in other clinical indicators, including the duration from onset to release form quarantine(P>0.05).

In the light of recent outbreak of COVID19 Pandemic for which is there no specific treatment, prevention and awareness is the only key to overcome an adversity of such magnitude. Thus, we aimed to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices of undergraduate medical students pertaining to infection with the COVID19. Methods. An electronic survey developed using an online cloud-based website (Survey Monkey) was served to undergraduate medical students. Participants had a week to voluntarily complete the 8 minute long questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and figures were obtained from surveymonkey.com. Results. Of 2507 invitees across six medical colleges in India, 616 (24.6%) responded. Most undergraduates (age 21.5 years, 46.1% males) were undergoing internship (16.7%) or final year undergraduate training (54.1%). Knowledge regarding viral transmission, clinical-radiologic features, laboratory diagnosis and treatment was adequate among most students (Fig 1). However, the understanding of the incubation period and time to symptoms was less than satisfactory (Supplementary Table 1). Nearly three-fourths 461 (74.8%) were aware of the COVID-19 specific precautions. While their universities had advised most regarding hand hygiene, social distancing, symptom identification, and high-risk groups, fewer were advised to avoid staying back in hostels or drug prevention. Nearly 70% were reluctant to attend clinics from fear of getting infected or passing on to others. Most students read about COVID-19 regularly, and social media accounts of medical journals were the primary 78.9% source. Conclusion.

From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross-sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with a high level of education (48.86% bachelor degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government. About 94% of the respondents identified contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). Regular hand washing and social distancing were selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soups as preventive measures against COVID-19. The majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly, and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) is the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19.

Even in Japan, epidemiological linkage of transmission was probably lost already by February 18, 2020. From that time, it has been necessary to detect clusters using syndromic surveillance. Method We identified common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, we constructed a model to predict the number of patients with antipyretic analgesics (AP) and multi-ingredient cold medications (MIC) controlling well-known pediatric infectious diseases including influenza or RS virus infection. To do so, we used the National Official Sentinel Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NOSSID), even though NOSSID data are weekly data with 10 day delays, on average. The probability of a cluster with unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms is a product of the probabilities of aberrations in AP and MIC, which is defined as one minus the probability of the number of patients prescribed a certain type of drug in PS compared to the number predicted using a model. This analysis was conducted prospectively in 2020 using data from October 1, 2010 through 2019 by prefecture and by age-class. Results The probability of unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptom cluster was estimated as less than 60% in 2020. Discussion The most severe limitation of the present study is that the proposed model cannot be validated. A large outbreak of an unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms must be experienced, at which time, practitioners will have to wing it.

However, little is known about its pathological mechanism, and there are still no clinical study reports on specific treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy on COVID-19. Methods In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, adult critical COVID-19 patients (including severe type and critical type, according to the clinical classification defined by National Health Commission of China) in 8 government designated treatment center in China from Dec 23, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, prognosis were extracted from electronic medical records, and IVIG was exposure factor. Primary outcomes were the 28 days and 60 days mortality, and secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Meanwhile, the parameters of inflammation response and organ function were detected. The risk factors were determined by COX proportional hazards model. The subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage and timing. Findings 325patients were included in this study, of whom 222 (68%) were severe type, 103 (32%) were critical type. 42 (13%) died in 28 days within hospitalization, total 54 (17%) died in 60 days, and 6 (3%) died in severe type, 48 (47%) died in critical type. 174 cases were used IVIG, and 151 cases were not. Compared with the baseline characteristics between two groups, the results showed that the patients in IVIG group had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHII) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, IL-6 and lactate level, lower lymphocyte count and oxygenation index (all P<0.05). The 28 day and 60 day mortality did not improve with IVIG in overall patients. The in-hospital stay and the total duration of disease were longer in IVIG group (p<0.001). Risk factors were clinical classification (hazards ratio 0.126, 95% confidence interval 0.039-0.413, P=0.001), and using IVIG (hazards ratio 0.252, 95% confidence interval 0.107-0.591, P=0.002) with COX regression. Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28 day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all p<0.05), and 60-day mortality reduced significantly by using IVIG in the early stage (admission≤7 days) and with high dose (>15 g/d). Interpretation Early and high dose of IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients only in critical type, which provides the clinical basis for the choice of treatment population and method of IVIG therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Local fabrication based on 3D printing is one way to address this challenge, particularly in the case of simple products such as protective face shields. As a consequence, many public domain designs for face shields have become available. No clear path exists, however, for introducing a locally fabricated and unapproved product into a clinical setting. In a US health care setting, face shields are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); similar policies exist in other countries. We describe a research protocol under which rapid iteration on an existing design, coupled with clinical feedback and real-world testing in an emergency department, allowed a face shield to be adopted by the incident command team at a major academic medical center. We describe our design and testing process and provide an overview of regulatory considerations associated with fabrication and testing of face shields and related products.

This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require the switching on and off of measures and for this reason eradication is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for eradication it is not be a good mechanism on its own to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up eradication, and be a better tool for prevention of infection or reinfection.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL,medrxiv,medrvix,,2.4,10.1101/2020.04.11.20062042

Design: Individual-based transmission modelling using Swedish demographic and Geographical Information System data and conservative COVID-19 epidemiological parameters. Setting: Sweden Participants: A model to simulate all 10.09 million Swedish residents. Interventions: 5 different non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions including the mitigation strategy of the Swedish government as of 10 April; isolation of the entire household of confirmed cases; closure of schools and non-essential businesses with or without strict social distancing; and strict social distancing with closure of schools and non-essential businesses. Main outcome measures: Estimated acute care and intensive care hospitalisations, COVID-19 attributable deaths, and infections among healthcare workers from 10 April until 29 June. Findings: Our model for Sweden shows that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, the current Swedish public-health strategy will result in a peak intensive-care load in May that exceeds pre-pandemic capacity by over 40-fold, with a median mortality of 96,000 (95% CI 52,000 to 183,000). The most stringent public-health measures examined are predicted to reduce mortality by approximately three-fold. Intensive-care load at the peak could be reduced by over two-fold with a shorter period at peak pandemic capacity. Conclusions: Our results predict that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, current measures in Sweden will result in at least 40-fold over-subscription of pre-pandemic Swedish intensive care capacity, with 15.8 percent of Swedish healthcare workers unable to work at the pandemic peak.

Serologic tests based on ELISA have been developed and evaluated as useful complements to PCR in these situations. However, there is scarce information about the usefulness of rapid tests based on immunochromatography. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of these rapid tests in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COV-19 IgG / IgM kit) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. First, we performed a validation of the serologic test using serum samples from 45 healthy control patients (group 1) and 55 confirmed by PCR cases of COVID-19 (group 2) in order to establish the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Then we prospectively employed the test in 63 patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology that were SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR (group 3), to establish the diagnostic performance in these patients. Results: All patients from group 1 (healthy controls) resulted negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100%). Regarding group 2 (PCR positive) patients, the median time from the onset of symptoms was 11 days and the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 26 out of 55 patients (overall sensitivity = 47.3%). However, in those patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 73.9%. Regarding group 3 patients, the median days from onset of symptoms was 17 and the test was positive in 56 out of 63 patients (88.9% positivity rate). In these group 3 patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the positivity rate was 91.1%. Conclusions: Our study shows that serologic rapid tests can be used as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms. These immunochromatographic devices could be especially useful in hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology with 14 or more days from the onset of symptoms and in whom the PCR has been negative.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|NORP,medrxiv,medrvix,,2-3 weeks|PCR|Serologic|ELISA|COVID-19|AllTest COV-19 IgG /|IgM|IgG|IgM|First|45|1|55|COVID-19|2|63|PCR|3|1|100%|2|11 days|IgM|IgG|26|55|47.3%|14 days|73.9%|3|days|17|56|63|88.9%|3|14 days|91.1%|14 days|14 or more days|PCR|IgG|IgM,10.1101/2020.04.11.20062158

We also included data from preprint articles. Study selection : Original case reports and case series on pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data extraction : We included 23 studies [China (20), USA (01), Republic of Korea (01) and Honduras, Central America (01) reporting the information on 172 pregnant women and 162 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also recorded. Results: Out of 172 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 160 women had delivered 162 newborns (2 set of twins, 12 ongoing pregnancies). In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (54%), cough (35%), myalgia (17%), dyspnea (12%) and diarrhea (4%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 100 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (89%), preterm labor (21%), fetal distress (9%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were diabetes (11%), hypertensive disorders (9%), placental disorders (5%), co-infections (6%), scarred uterus (5%), hypothyroidism (5%) and anemia (4%).

We wanted to compare specimen types and collection methods to explore if a simpler to collect specimen type could expand access to testing. Methods: We recruited individuals recently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through a testing program (drive-through). In homes of participants, we assessed the performance of self-collected oral fluid swab specimens with and without clinician supervision, clinician-supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (nasal) swab specimens, and clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We tested specimens with a validated reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and measured cycle threshold values. Symptom status and date of onset of symptoms was also recorded for each participant. Results: We recruited 45 participants. The median age of study participant was 42 years old (Interquartile range, 31 to 52 years). Of the participants, 29 had at least one specimen test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 21 (73%) of 29 reported active symptoms. By specimen type and home-based collection method, clinician-supervised self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 26 (90%) of 29 infected individuals, clinician-supervised self-collected nasal swab specimens detected 23 (85%) of 27, clinician-collected posterior nasopharyngeal swab specimens detected 23 (79%) of 29, and unmonitored self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 19 (66%) of 29. Despite nasopharyngeal swabs being considered the gold standard, 4 participants tested negative by clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab and positive by the 3 other specimen types. Additionally, false negative results by each sample type were seen to generally not overlap. Conclusions: Supervised self-collected oral fluid and nasal swab specimens performed similarly to, if not better than clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sample type captured all SARS-CoV-2 infections, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the distribution of viral load in different parts of the respiratory tract between individuals. Supervised self-collection performed comparably to clinician collection and would allow for rapid expansion of testing capacity in the United States by reducing the need for trained healthcare workers, reducing exposure of healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of PPE (personal protective equipment) being used for testing during a critical shortage.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE,medrxiv,medrvix,,2019|2|Covid-19|45|42 years old|Interquartile|31 to 52 years|29|at least one|21|73%|29|26|90%|29|23|85%|27|23|79%|29|19|66%|29|4|3|the United States|PPE|Self-Collected Oral Fluid|Clinician Collected Nasopharyngeal Swabs for,10.1101/2020.04.11.20062372

It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has ~89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON,biorxiv,biorxiv,,19|COVID-19|CoV|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|2003|CoV|Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible|CoV|CoV|1|2|SIS|Degree|DC|CC|LAC|Betweeness|BC|CoV,10.1101/2020.04.12.038216

After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE,biorxiv,biorxiv,,December 2019|137|2/23/2020|CoV|2003|years|Two|251V|first|1/5/2020|1/23/2020|Wuhan|251V|1/21/2020|China|two|Wuhan|China,10.1101/2020.04.12.038554

Upon observing a cluster of COVID-19 cases from a single large homeless shelter in Boston, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program conducted symptom assessments and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 among all guests residing at the shelter over a 2-day period. Of 408 participants, 147 (36.0%) were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-positive individuals were more likely to be male (p<0.001) but did not differ significantly from COVID-negative individuals with respect to other demographic and clinical characteristics. Cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), and fever (0.7%) were all uncommon among COVID-positive individuals. Our findings illustrate the rapidity with which COVID-19 can be widely transmitted in a homeless shelter setting and suggest that universal PCR testing, rather than a symptom triggered approach, may be a better strategy for identifying and mitigating COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|PERSON,medrxiv,medrvix,,COVID-19|Boston|Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program|2-day|408|147|36.0%|p<0.001|7.5%|1.4%|0.7%|COVID-19|Boston|Implications,10.1101/2020.04.12.20059618

However, few researches focused on the clinical features of death patients. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and mortal causes in Chinese COVID-19 death patients. Patients and methods: The clinical characteristics of death patients were collected from publicized by local health authorities in China. Expressions of virus targets in human organs were obtained from GTEx database. Results: 159 patients from 24 provinces in China were recruited in our study, including 26 young patients under 60 and 133 aged 60 or older. The median age was 71 years, which indicated that most death patients were elderly. More male patients died of COVID-19 than females (1.65 fold). Hypertension was the most common coexisting disorder and respiratory failure was the most common direct cause of death. Fever (71.19%) and cough (55.08%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. There was one asymptomatic patient. In addition, by comparing young and old patients, heart disease was identified as an important risk factor for death in the aged patients. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were the targets of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed their expression in different organs. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 had a high expression in the organs which had corresponding clinical features in death patients. Conclusion: Male, age and heart disease were the main risk factors of death. Beside, asymptomatic patients with serious coexisting disorders may also die of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, more attention should be paid to the old patients with heart disease and asymptomatic patients in the treatment .

However, the current CRISPR/Cas12a systems are limited to detecting DNA in a picomolar detection limit without an amplification step. Here, we developed a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect DNA, DNA/RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection of in femtomolar range without any target pre-amplification step. By extending the 3 prime- or 5 prime-ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discovered a new self-catalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12a-mediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5-fold compared to the wild-type crRNA. We applied this sensitive system to detect as low as 25 fM dsDNA from the PCA3 gene, an overexpressed biomarker in prostate cancer patients, in simulated urine over 6 hours. The same platform was used to detect as low as ~700 fM cDNA from HIV, 290 fM RNA from HCV, and 370 fM cDNA from SARS-CoV-2, all within 30 minutes without a need for target amplification.

Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a 'shield' in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PRODUCT|PRODUCT,biorxiv,biorxiv,,2|19|COVID-19|3C|3CLpro|3CLpro|Chinese|Baicalin|first|3CLpro|3CLpro|Baicalein|two|S1/S2|Discovery|3CL,10.1101/2020.04.13.038687

The COVID-19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease.

This novel study divulged two promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK and NFRVQPTESIV from surface glycoproteins (protein accession no. - QIA98583.1 and QHS34546.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which were predicated to be interacted with class I and class II MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigenic peptides with the residues of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I and HLA DRB1*04-01 allele for MHC class II. After vigorous analysis, these peptides were predicted to be suitable epitopes which are capable to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2.

While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants.

Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling has been reported to be causal in cytokine storm-associated pathology in several respiratory viral infections, however, the mechanisms by which IFN-I promotes disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that lack of deISGylation during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions, cytokine amplification, lung vascular leakage and death. This pathology requires T cells but not T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18. However, lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- or Usp18C61A mice which were dependent on Isg15. We further mechanistically demonstrate that interrupting the ISGylation/deISGylation circuit increases extracellular levels of ISG15 which is accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation to the lung. Importantly, neutrophil depletion reversed morbidity and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. In summary, we reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL,biorxiv,biorxiv,,1|USP18|Usp18|Usp18|Usp18-/-|Usp18C61A|ISGylation/deISGylation|neutrophil|Usp18C61A|Usp18|neutrophil,10.1101/2020.04.13.039321

Here, we propose the use of agglomerative sampling which can prune out multiple negative cases in a single test by intelligently combining samples from different individuals. The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples. The proposed scheme can also be used in conjunction with heuristic or Machine Learning guided clustering for improving the efficiency of large-scale testing further.

Here we first show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by a highly differentiated, primary, human lung airway epithelium cultured under an air-liquid interface and fed by continuous medium flow can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by influenza, as well as effects of existing and novel therapeutics. These Airway Chips, which contain human lung epithelial cells that express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were then used to assess the inhibitory activities of 7 clinically approved drugs (chloroquine, arbidol, toremifene, clomiphene, amodiaquine, verapamil, and amiodarone) that we found inhibit infection by viral pseudoparticles expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human Huh-7 cells, and others recently showed suppress infection by native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. However, when these drugs were administered under flow at the maximal concentration in blood reported in clinical studies in human Airway Chips, only two of these drugs - amodiaquine and toremifene - significantly inhibited entry of the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. This work suggests that human Organ Chip technology may be used in conjunction with existing rapid cell-based screening assays to study human disease pathogenesis and expedite drug repurposing in biothreat crises caused by pandemic viruses.",,biorxiv_medrxiv,ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT,biorxiv,biorxiv,,first|Organ Chip|These Airway Chips|7|Vero|Airway Chips|only two|Organ Chip|COVID19,10.1101/2020.04.13.039917

However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes.

Strikingly, the depletion of CD8+ TRM cells dampens persistent chronic lung inflammation and ameliorates tissue fibrosis in aged, but not young, animals.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect.

The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target. Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although IL-17 family members have been extensively studied in mammals, our knowledge of the activity of IL-17 proteins in teleosts in response to viral infection is still limited. In this study, the role of IL-17 in GCRV infection and its mechanism were investigated. The expression levels of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells gradually increased from 6 h after infection with GCRV. The nuclear translocation of p65, which acts in the NF-κB signaling pathway, was also increased by GCRV infection. The overexpression of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, or IL-17AF3 also promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 and the levels of phospho-IκBα in CIK cells, and reduced the expression of the viral structural protein VP7. An NF-κB signal inhibitor abolished the inhibition of GCRV infection by IL-17 proteins. These results suggested that the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by the overexpression of IL-17 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of viral infection.

In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines’ availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized “shortage” definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages. To support the activities of regulators, manufacturers and other healthcare professionals, an algorithm was also proposed to be used as a harmonized procedure to determine the shortage/unavailability impact on public health and to rationalize the problem-solving strategies adopted in all different settings.",2942764320,custom_license,ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|NORP|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|LOC|ORG|NORP|LOC,Elsevier,els-covid,#3143,Abstract Medicine|European|National Healthcare Systems|European Regulatory Authorities|years|European|2019|EMA|HMA|first|the European Economic Area|EEA|European|Europe,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171

We first determine the existence of a unique global positive solution and a positively invariant set for the stochastic system. Sufficient conditions for extinction and persistence in the mean of the disease are then achieved by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Based on the analysis, we conclude that noise intensity and the validity period of vaccination greatly influence the transmission dynamics of the system.",,custom_license,PERSON|ORDINAL|PERSON|PERSON,Elsevier,els-covid,,Le.́vy|first|Lyapunov|Lévy,10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379

Zika envelope domain III (ZE3) has been identified as a safe and effective vaccine candidate, however it is poorly immunogenic. We previously showed that plant-made recombinant immune complex (RIC) vaccines are a robust platform to improve the immunogenicity of weak antigens. In this study, we altered the antigen fusion site on the RIC platform to accommodate N-terminal fusion to the IgG heavy chain (N-RIC), and thus a wider range of antigens, with a resulting 40% improvement in RIC expression over the normal C-terminal fusion (C-RIC). Both types of RICs containing ZE3 were efficiently assembled in plants and purified to >95% homogeneity with a simple one-step purification. Both ZE3 RICs strongly bound complement receptor C1q and elicited strong ZE3-specific antibody titers that correlated with ZIKV neutralization. When either N-RIC or C-RIC was codelivered with plant-produced hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLP) displaying ZE3, the combination elicited 5-fold greater antibody titers (>1,000,000) and more strongly neutralized ZIKV than either RICs or VLPs alone, after only two doses without adjuvant. These findings demonstrate that antigens that require a free N-terminus for optimal antigen display can now be used with the RIC system, and that plant-made RICs and VLPs are highly effective vaccines targeting ZE3. Thus, the RIC platform can be more generally applied to a wider variety of antigens.",,custom_license,PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON,Elsevier,els-covid,,"ZIKV|Zika|III|RIC|RIC|IgG|N-RIC|40%|RIC|C-RIC|95%|one|ZIKV|N-RIC|C-RIC|VLP|5-fold|1,000,000|ZIKV|only two|RIC|ZE3|RIC|Zika",10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.02.089

Investigating the relation between cardiovascular disease and exposure to a complex mixture of air pollutants requires holistic approaches. We assessed the relationship between exposure to multiple air pollutants and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a general population sample. We collected data in the Lille MONICA registry (2008–2011) on 3268 incident cases (age range: 35–74). Based on 20 indicators, we derived a composite environmental score (SEnv) for cumulative exposure to air pollution. Poisson regression models were used to analyse associations between CHD rates on one hand and SEnv and each single indicator on the other (considered in tertiles, where T3 is the most contaminated). We adjusted models for age, sex, area-level social deprivation, and neighbourhood spatial structure. The incidence of CHD was a spatially heterogeneous (p=0.006). There was a significant positive association between SEnv and CHD incidence (trend p=0.0151). The relative risks [95%CI] of CHD were 1.08 [0.98–1.18] and 1.16 [1.04–1.29] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of SEnv exposure. In the single pollutant analysis, PM10, NO2, cadmium, copper, nickel, and palladium were significantly associated with CHD rates. Multiple air pollution was associated with an increased risk of CHD. Single pollutants reflecting road traffic pollution were the most strongly associated with CHD. Our present results are consistent with the literature data on the impact of road traffic on the CHD risk in urban areas.",,custom_license,ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG,Elsevier,els-covid,,CHD|Lille|2008–2011|3268|35–74|20|SEnv|Poisson|CHD|SEnv|T3|CHD|p=0.006|SEnv|CHD|CHD|1.08|0.98–1.18|1.16|1.04–1.29|the 2nd and 3rd|SEnv|PM10|CHD|CHD|CHD|CHD,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136608
