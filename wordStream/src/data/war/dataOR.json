DISCUSSION During eration LE JEUNE there were DB instances when ground troops would have been greatly assisted if they could fire CS nades at ranges farther than 25 to 30 meters. grenade launcher type device affixed to Qe 16 rifie would have allow ed the individual soldier to place non persistant CS grenades on tar get more accuratel7 an at greater distance than by simply throwing them by ham. In addition the adapter could have been used to fire the standard smoke grenade which could have been of gre assistance in ma rld ng targets for aircraft VATION he 16 rifle shculd be modified for tiring cs and tta smoke grenades. cs placed accurately near the apertures or bunker an in sufficient quantity WOuld incapacitate the en within thereby allowing the infantrymen to close in am destroy or capture him. Thi type modi tication WOuld be extremely valuable for marking targets for airstrikes and gunships. ITEM cupation of Positions DISCUSSION hjor problems were encountered by an artillery battery upon occupation of position on the beach. The major difficulty was preventing the trails trom creeping back when charge or above was fired were the major difficulties. OBSERVATION lhese problems can be eliminated by building platform under the wheels to prevent them from sinking in to the sand. The howitzer can be further stabilized by the use of l05 am jungle pack camisters filled with sand and braced by engineer stakes to minimize creeping. mH Sling IDading of fi scellaneous Equipment. DISCUSSION When displacing Battalion Company forward fire bases it is often necessary to transport much equipment which can not be carried in rifleman 1s pack. Mortars medical supplies comoo equipment and heavy amnunition become hinderance when these items mat be internally loaded on ai type of aircraft. In these instances much time am energy is experrled umecessarily. OBSERVATION The use of general purpose sling great ly ebhances the transporting of miscellaneous equipment. This method ves time and energy norma spent in loading an aircratt enables the aircraft to carry additional payloads arrl cuts down turn around time. Each unit should have available GP slings for use in building external loads. 11 Jtil 1967 SUBJECT Combat Operations After Action Report tor JmHE.

Over 1100 Air Force Navy Marine and VNAF strike sorties wer flown during the period expending ne rly 2000ton of ordnance. night illumination was provided by USAF 123 Smokey Bear apd 47 flareships with fire support from Dragon AC 47. Airlift upport by the USAF continued throughout the period of operation. and 27 February 130 were used. time for in theater close logistic support by assault landing at Bong Son. In total over 1000 tons of supplies and equipment were flown into Bong Son by 123 and 130. Ground forces support material was also airlifted to other points where it could be trans shipped by ground lines of communication to the area of opera on. SECRET This document deals only with the ls Air Ca alry participation of the operation and does not deal with the ARVN or ROK forc. The ARVN area of operation was pr1ma rilyto the north and west of the 1st Cavalry between the coast and Route. The ROK uitits took over the security of the roads to th south and west of the area of. opera tion freeing elements of the 1st Cavalry for commitment to dle opera tion. Bo the ARVN and ROK forces gaged in heavy fighting and were responsible for large number of Viet Cong casualties. This 1st Air Cavalry operatio was actually conducted in four distinct phases MASHER WHITE WING EAGLE CLAW and BLACK HORSE. Each phase is covered separately in the overall report. To assist the read er in identifying abbreviations used in the report. glossary of terms is listed on page 30. SECRET OPERATION MASHER MASHER was multi battalion search and destroy operation conducted by the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry Division to the north of Bong Son. The terrain fought over consisted of vast rice paddy along the South China Sea Coast bounded on the west by the Da Dan Mountain beyond which lies An Lao Valley. The brigade intelligence estimate of VC North Vietnamese Army units amounted to four battalions with possible reinforcement capability of two regiments. Operation MASHER was conducted in three phases. Phase beginning on 24 Jan 66 was the movement of the maneuver battalions to the opera tion area by USAF 123 Army UH lD and CH 47 and ground vehicles Phase II planned for the morn ng of 25 Jan 66 began with the 1st Batta lion of the 7th Regiment Cav making diversionary attack on hill mass to the southeast of Bong Son GEORGE The Cav was to move to te north to secure Position DOG for the Brigade Command Post. Phase III was to start on 28 Jan 66 with airmobile and ground attacks north up the coastal plain by the Cav air landing of the Cavon the high ground to the west then attacking to the east. The 12 Cav was to be landed in the northern end of the area of operation and would attack to the south. Thus with the AaVN on. the east the enemy would be hit from four directions. Poor weather caused change in the Phase III portion which will be discussed. subsequently Phase movement to the area of operation commenced on the mornirig of 24 Jan and was completed on 27 Jan.

Most of these sorties were responsiye to requests for air cover during the day. 123 AC 47 and 47 fiareships were utili zed for night support. Phase III the main attack of Operation MASHER was launched at 0800Hon 28 Jan 66 in extremely poor weather. Rain and low ceilings prev nted movement of troops onto the high ground north and west of. the area of operation. Consequently the attack plan had to be Dlodified. Cav mo ved into LZ PAPA on the 28th. On the morning of the 29th the battalion received orders to move to the east make contact with ARVN forces then attack to the north. Between 0908H and 1420H 29 Jan 66 three air strikes were delivered on enemy positions in the vicinity of the LZ. During the strik es 12 Cavalry was brought in on the right flank of SECRET.

SECRET operation The river valley is covered with elephant grass five to six feet high and the surroundingmountatns are heavily forested. The area was so dense with jungle growth that landing zones were extremely limited in size and number Because of the intense fighting that took place in this area it was nicknamed The Iron Triangle. Based on the defensive positions and number and type of weapons encountered it was estimated that elements of the 93rd and 95th Battalions of the Quyet Chien 2n VC Regiment and elements of the Regimental Headquarters and Weapons Battalion were engaged in the lron Triangle Extensive TAC Air was used to prepare landing zones and air cover was used throughout the operation to strike at pockets of enemy resistance. Also during the operation SAC prOVided 52 strike on the Iron Triangle. The attack was made with two fli ghts 11 ofthre aircraft each with excellent coverage. The operation commenced on 16 February with an air strike on objective COIL followed by 20 minute artillery preparation. Cavalry was airlifted into COIL Cavalry closed into RECOIL and Company of Cav alry was moved to LZ MIKE to round out the blocking pOSitions. At 0630H 17 Feb 66 artillery fired preparatory rounds into the area between COIL and RECOIL and two companies of Cavalry moved west from COIL toward the blocking position set up by Cavalry. SECRET Artillery and tactical Air was utilized to support the ground troops. By l800H enemy had broken contact after losing an estimated 227 men 127 body count and another 100 by estimate. From the heavy weapons automatic fire network of bunkers andcomniunications wire found in the area it was determined that Cavalry had attacked and destroyed heavy weapons battalion. Earlier on the morning of the 17th Company of 12 Cavalry operating southeast of PONY had come unde. heavy enemy attack by an estimated Viet Cong Company at 04l5H Artillery and Smokey Bear flare aircraft were used in support of the company with the enemy breaking contact at 0700H.

Both companies broJte contact while two flights of IE and ar tillerr raked the area. to the high ground and conducted coordinated attack agains the enemy positions causing the enemy to withdraw. After the action 36 Viet. 33 Cong bodies were found in the area. On 20 February 1966 and CII Companies of Cavalry ere stili in blocking positions around the Iron Triangle. Company attacked the enemy stronghold after heavy artillery prei ara tion but once again was stopped by concentrated fire power from well constructed positions. The company withdr and once again artillery. and tactical air began to pound the area. On 21 February 1966 most of the activity involved learing troops from the area of the Iron Tr angle to prepare for 52 strike later in the day. One platoon of Company moved into the area early in. the mar ing and once again received heavyfire from the same position. The pl toon was withdraWn. At 1000H the first flight of 52 dropped its bombs and at 1601H he second flight struck. Lynch 2nd Briga de Commander was airborne to observe the strike and witnessed the first bomb when it detonated. That first 34 explosion was right on the money and the target coverage was fanta tic 22. SECRET BY darkness and Companies were backed up to the area where they stayed for the night. On the morning of 22 February 1966 liS Cavalry attacked into the Iron Triangle They encountered no resistance but found 41 bodie and numerous weapons throughout the area. From the 23rd through the 2rth there was no major action. The 2nd Brigade portion of EAGLE CLAW resulted 339 Vi Con KIA KBA body count 409 Viet Cang KIA KBA estiniated 1023 WIA estimated and VietCong captured. American losses were 48 KIA and 211 WIA. The significant role played by tactical air was poipted out in the 2nd Brigade after action report The extensiv use of artillery and. tactical air inflicted great losses on th ene my. The exact number will never be known however blood trails and bloody bandages found throughout the area indi cated that the enemy suffered more casualties than were counted Several thousand rounds of artill ry and approxi mately 20 sorties of tactical were fired into the ItIro Triangle. All of the above described fire power including the 52 strike was necessary to prevent heavy casualties to the infantry whi had attacked the area fro three directions on the two 35 previous ays. On the first of March the 2nd Brigade moved into the Cay Giep Mountains to the southeast of Bong Son to initiate Operation BLACK HORSE. The Brigade made very little contact with the ene as evidenced by the small number of Viet Cong killed. Through the 4th of March when the operation was terminated only 19 Viet Cong were reported killed. Tactical air was used to prepare landing zones and to. strike at suspected Viet Cong targets throughout the area of operation. Lynch the Brigade Commander was very well pleased with the job done lil by tactical air in the clearing of landing zones. Because of the extremely dense foliage air strikes had to be used to clear away enough of the cover to allow troops to be lowered into the area by ladder to finish the job with chain saws. On the 4th and 5th of March the 2nd Brigade moved from Bong Son back to he ase camp at An Khe thus completing the movement of the 11 1st Air Cavalry out of the area of operation. SECRET SUMMARY In the WHITE WING MASHER operation the Viet Cong lost 1342 killed body count another estimated 1746 killed 1348 estimated woun ed and 633 Viet Cong captured including battalion commander mortar. company commander and the executive officer of regimental headqua ters company There were 485 Cheiu Hoi rall and 1087 Viet Cong suspects detained. There were 208 individual weapons and 52 crew served weapons captured during the operation. Friendly losses were 228 killed includ ing 42 1st Air Cavalry personnel killed in 123 crash on 25 Jan 66 and 788 wounded. In addition four USA crew members were killed in the 33 123 crash and two USAF. were killed in an crash on Mar 66. There were 600 USAF tactical air sorties flown througho the operation an average of 14 per day. USAF tactica aircraft dropped 427 25 tons of GP bombs 165 30 tons of napalm and 265 32 tons of frag bombs. An estimated 102 nemy troop were killed by USAF aircraft with another 20 kiiled by air accord ing to body count. Fifty of the estimated Viet Cong killed by air were accounted for on 29 Jan 66 during the heavy contact of the Cavalry when IE of the 602nd Fighter 39 Squadron raked enemy trenches with GP napalm and WP. Airlift both Army and USAF played heavy role during the operation. Between 25 January and March 1966 9700 tons of cargo were airlifted along 93 351 passengers. In all 78 infantry battalions and 55 artillery batteries were moved by air. The division kept at least four infantry 25 SECRET. SECRET battalions and six for the majority of the period in su tained operations for 4ldays at an average distance. QI An Khe base of 65 kilometers. The Division after action report commented on the role of air. One significant remark was that. attacking ground units could best exploit close artillery and air SUpport in mountainous terrain when the directions of flight or gun target lines generally paralleled the long axis of he objective area Le the valley floor ridge line. In this way the ground force could attack from direction perpendicular to the line of flight or fire with greater safety. Also more of the ordnance could be exp ended in the intended objective areas than when the direction of flight or firing was cross compartment. AU lO psywar aircraft of the 5th Air Commando Squadron was used throughout the operation on day and night. miSSions carrying normal leaflet and loudspeaker messages as well as funeral dirges and wai ling sounds over enemy areas following period of heavy contact. 421 craft was used to play on the superstitious beliefs of the enemy. Comm nting on the reaction time of USAF tactical air suppor the division noted that all immedi ate requests had 15 30 minute reaction time. Imm ate requests were submitted by Air Force radio ts while pre planned requests were submitted by Army communications land line. DASC Alpha at Nha Trang handled all tactical air requests. Of the total sorties flown 390 were pre planned and 210 were immediates QI 26 SECRET. SECRtT The USAF ALO with the 1st Brigade which was in the field between 17 February and 27 February 19 pointed out several problem areas in tactical air support. He noted that the requirement for submitting pre planned requests by lOOOH of the previous day did not permit realistic planning after the initial move or assault. more realistic time would be 1900H he said to allow for realistic planning at all levels. In one case three pre planned requests were not filled be cause the tried to use the air CAP which previously expended on immediates. There was some misuse of air according to the ALO 1st Brigade Major James. The Cavalry called for objective pr parations by tactical air and then the objective was never taken. Maj or Mullins repo rted that the average time from receipt of immedi ate requests for fighters to fighters overhead was less than 15 minutes. Tactical air was responsible for saving elements of the and 12 and the Brigade Commander felt that tactical air was directly responsible for destroying the enemy 18th Regiment CP an routing the enemy On one occasion division struck target within the Brigade TAOR without informing Brigade. This created roblem of safety for friendlies and it alerted the enemy in an area planned for assault in the next few days. On another occasion an assault was delayed because an air strike was conducted over the area where choppers were trying to lQ move out artillery. Communications between ground stations and between ground and air wa or Major Mullins said. He suggested use of the PRC 7l on the next operation. Also the use of FAC in the TOC ship was found to be very effective. Air Force Army coordination was expedit ed and the exact location of friendlies was more accurately determined by the air il borne FAC. Major Mullins recommended that FAC not be sent to the ield. Two FACts could be placed at Brigade and if the need arose one could forward to provide FAC service. The Brigade Commander visited each unit twice day and coordination could be accomplish ed by the ALO at this time. This would also put more airborne FAC on duty and increase chances of survival by having two FAC and FAC aircraft up at the same 21 time. FAC with the avalry Captain Loring. Latimer reported that CBiJ effectiveness in jungle terrain was questionable Many unex ploded bombs were found and in several cases troops were handling them not knowing what they were. He recommended that all troops be briefed on the size shape and color of bOinblets and that CBU be used 48 in open terrain to reduce the dud rate. Many FAC involved in the operation reported that commanders of their units were highly impressed by the performance of air during MASHER WHITE WING. The response time for immediate requests was parti cularly impressive. Considerable praise was also given to S2 support 28 SECRET. which was considered to have contributed heavily to the reduction of friendly casualtie.

Beyond the regular round of duties there was also civic action work to be done with the orphanages. This work took me to the IIChildren Home of Blessingll Chi nese Christian orphanage in the Saigon Chalan area. The home houses about 30 children regularly and provides free schooling for about 150 more from the neighborhood. The surroundings are neat and clean as the young irls are quick to point out. Of course part of the real joy of this ministry is to meet and work with the young children of this war rn land and see them given fresh start in the wc rld. Finally the regular job as Assistant Force Chaplain provided numerous opportlmities to travel and meat our various Navy Chaplains in Vietnam. This gave me an op portunity to discuss the circuit riding ministry of our vJUPf CT Salgon Chaplains and also the 0ther fine work of our chaplains in country Thus as one can see in one year have traveled the length and breadth of Vietnam serving as Assistant Force Chaplain for NAVFOt assisti ng in NAVSUPPACT Chaplain Jffice circuit riding f8r NAVSUPPACT Saigon working as base chaplain for NSA Detachment ba De an also its first Civic Action Officer.

The maintenance effort is primarily preventive in nature 1rJhen vehicle does become deacllined maximum effort is made to accomplish the necessary repair. At the preS only one vehicle has been deadlined over 15 days. This vehicle 274 mule has been deadlined since 30 October because of broken universal joint. Parts are not obtainable at the present time. Supply Recently there was shortage of 14 rifles. however this has been alleviated for the present There continues to be she rtage of indiVidual equipmento Nany items including individual protective armor are unserviceable or rapidly approaching that state. This shortage was accentuated due to transferring of personnel from this command to other units in country Ji th individual equipment and weapoDs. Replacements were fro eONUS and arrived without individual equipment and weapons. Because of this imbalance and rapid turn over rate it bas been difficult or impossible in some cases to maintain the required items for issue to new personnel.

Artillery There was one four. gun 105mm Howitzer Battery Battery from 2nd Battalion 11th harines at Tien Phuo in dfre ct support of the 3rd Battalion 5th harines during Operation CORTEZ There were no serious problems encountered with the emplo nnent and delivery of artillery. The missions were timely and accurate. All liaison nets were monitored constantly and nussions WerE cleared in min imum amount of time. Ba ttery 2nd Battalion 11th iarines. fired one observed mis. sion of round WP and rounds HE. which totaled 203 HE rounds. The night defenSive fires were exten sively used procedures for requesting and clearing them were fully adequate. Air Standard medevac procedures were used and in only one case was there any difficulty. An outpost approx 1000 meters from the peri meter took casualties one of which was an emergency and the radio operator had difficulty directing the gunship on target thus delaying the evac 10 minutes. Another emergency medevac was cancelled about the time the aircraft Qrri ved overhead because the WIA had died and the landing zone was not secure enough to merit trying to evacuate the body. During the operation an air delivery by 130 Dircraft was accomplished. Several problems were encountered which might possibly have been eliminated if the aircraft commander had realized the limita tionS of the PRC 41. The radio very limited line of sight capability requires the aircraft to circle tightly overhead for the ground brief ing. This was not done and the drop was made about 800 meters off target. This resulted in the supplies remaining outside the manned perimeter overnight. TJ1e laQ was SucceSS in that the supplies were recov er ed ir iaet Weverf conJ unication was the major problem. bb3 an FIlil frequ enc. sreqKe stA as primary and 99 HF frequency as back up. out tne rcraft did not have an FlVl capability and the ground unit did not have the HF capability. The 1M was contacted on 99 at the rear area and upon learning of the difficulty attempted to shift both aircraft and ground unit to Button Redll UHF and in turn Button Brown. Nevertheless comnJUnications was not established. NClASSIFlED DstciWi DECLASSIFIED DECLASSIFIED rru 1if ng of the downed CH 46 by the liflying craneil was handled competently and quickly Orig n311y it hEld beEn suggested hat the crane upon departure from the area circlE to the northeast how eyer the pilot chose straight line course nearly eastward cmd received enemy ground fire miles outside of the safe perimeter. Nevertheless no further difficultiesl wer encountered and the mission was accomplish ed without incident. Three fixed wing strikes were conducted on one hill mass dur ing the first two days. The stnkes were conducted by gunship TAC and monitored by an enlisted FAG representative. No fire was received from this particular area for the following six days. Ext raction of the Battalion started rather slowly with only 34 however within 3D hour gained morrimtum with the addi bion of CH 461s. The lift was completed in slightly over hours. Under the circumstances of distance moved and difficult approach the time period is commendable. Noteworthy is the excellent cooperation of the pilots in negotiating the landing sites requested and shuttling refugees to Tam KyNe Lift Hamlet. Gunships proved invaluable during the extraction by sup preSSing the ground fire on the departure route. Based on interrogation and screening of VCS and refugees it is felt that there has not been significant main force activity in the CORTEZ area in recent months. This is substained by the fact that weap ons encountered in enemy contact during the oper tion were limited to automatic and semi automatic small arms and various types of booby traps. VC activity waS limited to acts of harrasslng nature. No uniis either local or main force bGen idGntifiEd subsequent to CORTEZ. Based on statements made during screening of locol citizens it appears that ee ch hamlet has from three to ten armed guerrilles in oddition to the normal infrastructure ond organizdions common to VC controlled areas old manls assn youth assn autonomous committee security cadre tax collectors etc. hany individuals concerned have been named in later interrogation reports processed by 9th ITT. The local VC appear to be well organ zGd Qnd equipped and have full control of the area exclUSive of the times. or ARVN operations are being conducted there. Tunnel and cave complexes are common throughout the area see diagrams. All villages and key terrain features were to varying de grees fortified. Sniping and booby trapping activities carried on by the localVC were effective but these forces at no time demonstrated willingness to engage the Marines inclose or heavy combat. Judging from the number of refugeGs who were volunterily evacuc jed 60 and statements made by them they are less th ln satisfied with liv ing conditions under VC dOmination. Iiiany had heard of the New Life Hamlets and that the people there are happy. Apparently the peasantsa re subject to being taxE from 30 to 50 of their rice harvest. All their property must be declared at the regularly scheduled hamlet meetings based on thiS other taxes are periodically levied dependent of the local VC needs at hat me. The fear of periodic bombings and shellings by ARVN and. forces also cont butes to their willingness to be evac uated. Nany the refugees lost rel 1tives or had their homes and live stock destroyed the recent ARCLIGHT raid. Based on these findings it is felt that Ps War and ChiEm Hoi efforts in this nrea might be met with some success. Terrain in the CORTEZ area is dominated by low to high hills with medium to heavy scrub vegetation and prima junglG canopy in plaCeS of up to 100 feet. Paddies are generally well worked nnd are presently in undated. Soil is chiefly sand and clay. The m2in avenue of approach is trail running from BT 160175 east to BT 172174 where it forks. The north fork runs generally northe2St While the southern fork jOins the Tien Phuoc Tam Ky Road at BT 202162. Two other trails leading into the area are from the southwest and the north as indicated on the Tam Ky sheet 6040 II Vietnam 50 000. Sur rounding high ground BT 162204 Jnd BT 163167 can provide fair to good obServation. Cover and concealment is excellent for sta tiO lary pOSitions and secondary trails due to heavy undergrowth and prepared tunnels and fortifications. Jjovement along main trails and in paddy areas in generQll exposed. The CORTEZ area definitely favors the defend er. Following the execution of an JiRCLIGHT raid the 3rd Bat talion arines was ass gned the following mission. At hour on day Company Rein was to land in the ARCLIGHT area and thoroughly recon and evaluate both physical damage and psycho logical effect achieved.

Resupply During Operation CORT EZ all resupply was accoriJp1ished by. helicopter eXC6 one air drop oh Dece er by 130 AGo Air drop of supplies waS conduct9d on an experimental basiS and encountered some problems. The coordination of preloaded supplies for the air drop WaS accomplished at Danang. The major problem resulted from the fact that the 130 craft was not FE equipped resulting in negative communications with the groulld units. Because ofthls communications problem the supplies were dropped 800 mGters beyond the drop zone. Due to the duration. and number of troops involved in the op eration Logistido 1Support Area was 10cat6d at the field CP BT 465072. No resupply probler 1S were encountered.

Transportation TransiJortation to support tactical nd logistical require ments was effectively accomplished via helicopter as necessary. Comrrillnications During Operation CORTEZ the relay comm nications were barely adequate to provide the Commander with the proper command liaison because of distance and terrain interference. The Regimental Tactical Net was hampered by faulty radio set at the Tam Ky retransmission site. vJire waS not employed because of he mObile situation. After map studies the Battalion Tac Net initially was set up to utilize relay site at Tam Ky. It is felt that site of higher elevaticn should have been uSed to assure line of sight com munication line between the field relay site and rear. Adequate communications were on hand in the field for tactical control on the scene. SPEDIAL EC1UIP lEl lT AND TECHNIQUES. Air Drop At 1800 on 3rd Battalion 5th Marines attempted its first resupply via airdrop. The only major problem encountered was with com munications as has been previously explained. Air delivery with minor improvements. should prove its elf to uf great value as means of resupply. Air delivery of this nature should if rehearsed and refined help relieve the helicopters in their resupply role. This vill allow greater number of helicopters to be free for supporting tactical troop movement and medevacs.
