However, this would not be realized (we are already near wet bulb temperature) and would result in very small decreases in variable speed fin fan at best.  There would be no realized savings on the DHT end as they are operating the feed preheater with the product bypass closed (so we would likely just heat the product up more by bypassing my cooler resulting in more Haze issues for them).  At this point, I would recommend no changes. Path forward is to quantify savings of shutting down LCO pumps at the tank farm and compare to cost of upgrading DHT product cooling exchangers.
