        <div> The challenge data is processed directly within the web browser, including removing duplicated/repeated posts, removing spams (sale promotions), extracting keyworks based on an earthquake taxonomy, and aggregating posts by hour. To determine the problems across the St. Himark, we first built the earthquake taxonomy for related events and resources needed for the situation:<br><br>
        <b>Events:</b>

                        <li>Ground damage: mudslide, rupture, landslides, liquefaction</li>
                        <li>Flooding: tsunami, flood</li>

            <b>1. Control panel</b> includes

        <div> <b>2. Main view: </b><br> We use the dynamic netwrok visualization, called <a href="https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs">TimeArc</a>, to visulize the evolution of different topics and the correlations between them. As shown in the main view of Figure 1, TimeArc has 2 main components: the stream graphs of topics depict the popularity of these topics over time and the arcs between topics present the cooccurrences in the text messages from social media posts. The thickness of links indicates how often the 2 topics mentioned together in Y*INT messages. </div><br>

        <div> <b>3. Detail view: </b><br>
        The detailed Y*INT messages of a partucular events/topics are presented to users in tabular format on demand. This allows users to investigate into the content of the social media posts by selecting a topic or a link in our time series view (TimeArcs).

        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.</div>

        <div>The Figure 2 (A) shows earthquake event have 3 pulse (2pm Mon 06, 7am Wed 08, 2pm Thu 09) and the St. Himark map colored by number of post mentioned earthquake or similar terms (seismic, quake, shake, shaking, wobble, quiver, epicenter and aftershock). The Figure 2 (B) The 2nd pulse have strong relation ship with Downtown,
            West Parton and Palace Hills and the 3rd pulse have more connections than the 2nd, such as Weston, Southton, Cheddarford, Southwest, East Parton and Boardview. In Figure 2 (B), the map show only posts related to the strong connection.

        <div> The distribution of resource can be mapping with resource name in this aplication:

                <li> sewer repair crews: sewer, water</li>

        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. Road and bridge related posts and the story.</span></p>
        <div>
            Road crews need to be assigned during 5 hours after 2nd earthquake pulse and 4 hours after 3rd earthquake pulse.
            The mayor location need road crew is DownTown, Old Town, Scenic Vista Cheddarford, Southon and the bridges. There is one user - DOT-StHimark reports all information about roads and bridge in Figure 3 (B). At the end of the Y*INT data (C), there are 3 bridges/route still close:
            Tranky Doo Bridge, Wilson Forest Highway and 12th July Bridge (connected with Safe town). We believe this related to the leak contaminated water event in mini-challenge 2.

        <h3>+ power</h3>

        <div>
            People concern about Nuclear Plant and the efficiency of it much more time than report for power problem. However, the need of power is significant increasing during 6 hours after 2nd earthquake and keep fluctuating 26 hours after. The demand for power is very high
            and also related to roads and bridge resource in certain point due to the spams (B). The possible for allocate power is Cheddarford, Southwest, Scenic Vista, PalaceHill and DownTown.

        <div>
        There is the sight of broken sewer pipe in Downtown just 2 hour after earthquake ( Figiure 4 (B) ). Then, 5 hours after earthquake, the peak of sewer demand is reached because the broken sewer pipe lead to risk of <b>contaminated drinking water</b>.
            That happen in Old Town, Safe Town, Scenic Vista, Broadview, Chapparal and Easton. In the next 5 hours, the situation became worst and lead to <b>flooding</b> in Old Town. From this point, the sewer crew need to be assign in the area zone around Safe town. Moreover,
            the sewer problem around 3rd earthquake is not as serious as the 2nd. However, from citizen posts (C), the sewer system is not recover and come to solution using portable restroom for a month.

            According to Figure 6, The demand for medical is very high during 15 hours after 2nd Earthquake and the 1st wave of demand appear 3-6 hours after earthquake. Some report of medical related to the roads status such as (B). This rescure team need to be availabel in the areas located near earthquake center such as
            Old Town, Safe town, Scenic Vista and the crowned place like DownTown. Additionally, The medical needed link to the shelter demand from 6 hours to 15 hours after Earthquake. The messages in (C) provide come information related to shelter demand.

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">2- Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of city resources. What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? What locations were affected? Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>

        <div>At the 1st time point (A), Medical and roads are involved mostly in Downtown. The 2nd wave of demand (B) is after the major earthquake require all resources and the most essential resource is medical in entire city.
        The final wave of demand (C) requires Medical, Power and Sewer from center of the city.</div>

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">3- Take the pulse of the community. How has the earthquake affect life in St. Himark? What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images.</div>
        <br>
        Besides resources in question2 and 3, citizen also care about food (Figure 8) and water (Figure 9). According to figure 8, food isn't a big issue, yet some place such as Oak Willow the food problem come from traffic delay and the closed route.

        <div>Due to the problem with sewer, 5 hours after 2nd earthquake, the water need to be boiled in order to drink. In the next 5 hours, the flooding happens. However, after 13 hours, water is not the problem.</div>

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">4- The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency. Describe how you analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream. How do you think this choice affected your analysis? Limit your response to 200 words and 3 images.</div>
        <div>The data using in this application is an array of message and have been process directly from web browser. In the real situation with larger dataset, the best solution is using web server which process the data before
        sending the extract terms to client via web api. Moreover, the accuracy of this method can be improve if using server rather than using client browser. However, whether using server or not, our web application still have ability to
        analysis static and dynamic data. The process for analysis data is included in the system overview ang can be apply to both statics and stream data.</div>
